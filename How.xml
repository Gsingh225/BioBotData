        <justification>The Calvin cycle is named for Melvin Calvin, who, along with his colleagues, began to elucidate its steps in the late 1940s.

        <justification>Phase 1: Carbon fixation. The Calvin cycle incorporates each CO2 molecule, one at a time, by attaching it to a five-carbon sugar named ribulose bisphosphate (abbreviated RuBP). The enzyme that catalyzes this first step is RuBP carboxylase, or rubisco. (This is the most abundant protein in chloroplasts and is also thought to be the most abundant protein on Earth. ) The product of the reaction is a six-carbon intermediate so unstable that it immediately splits in half, forming two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (for each CO2 fixed).</justification>

Palisade mesophyll consists of one or more layers of elongated parenchyma cells on the upper part of the leaf. Spongy mesophyll is below the palisade mesophyll. These parenchyma cells are more loosely arranged, with a labyrinth of air spaces through which CO2 and oxygen circulate around the cells and up to the palisade region.

    <text>How does a phosphorylation cascade affect a signal?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 11.10 A phosphorylation cascade. In a phosphorylation cascade, a series of different molecules in a pathway are phosphorylated in turn, each molecule adding a phosphate group to the next one in line. In this example, phosphorylation activates each molecule, and dephosphorylation returns it to its inactive form. The active and inactive forms of each protein are represented by different shapes to remind you that activation is usually associated with a change in molecular shape. Many of the relay molecules in signal transduction pathways are protein kinases, and they often act on other protein kinases in the pathway. Figure 11.10 depicts a hypothetical pathway containing three different protein kinases that create a "phosphorylation cascade. " The sequence shown is similar to many known pathways, including those triggered in yeast by mating factors and in animal cells by many growth factors. The signal is transmitted by a cascade of protein phosphorylations, each bringing with it a

        <justification>Equally important in the phosphorylation cascade are the protein phosphatases, enzymes that can rapidly remove phosphate groups from proteins, a process called dephosphorylation. By dephosphorylating and thus inactivating protein kinases, phosphatases provide the mechanism for turning off the signal transduction pathway when the initial signal is no longer present. Phosphatases also make the protein kinases available for reuse, enabling the cell to respond again to an extracellular signal. The phosphorylation-dephosphorylation system acts as a molecular switch in the cell, turning activities on or off, or up or down, as required.</justification>

        <justification>As a molecule of mRNA is moved through a ribosome, codons are translated into amino acids, one by one. The interpreters are tRNA molecules, each type with a specific anticodon at one end and a corresponding amino acid at the other end. A tRNA adds its amino acid cargo to a growing polypeptide chain when the anticodon hydrogen-bonds to a complementary codon on the mRNA. The figures that follow show some of the details of translation in a bacterial cell. In the process of translation, a cell "reads" a genetic message and builds a polypeptide accordingly. The message is a series of codons along an mRNA molecule, and the translator is called transfer RNA (tRNA). The function of tRNA is to transfer amino acids from the cytoplasmic pool of amino acids to a growing polypeptide in a ribosome. A cell keeps its cytoplasm stocked with all 20 amino acids, either by synthesizing them from other compounds or by taking them up from the surrounding solution. The ribosome, a structure made of proteins 
and RNAs, adds each amino acid brought to it by tRNA to the growing end of a polypeptide chain (Figure 17.14).</justification>

        <justification>A tRNA molecule consists of a single RNA strand that is only about 80 nucleotides long (compared to hundreds of nucleotides for most mRNA molecules). Because of the presence of complementary stretches of nucleotide bases that can hydrogen-bond to each other, this single strand can fold back upon itself and form a molecule with a three-dimensional structure. Flattened into one plane to clarify this base pairing, a tRNA molecule looks like a cloverleaf (Figure 17.15a). The tRNA actually twists and folds into a compact three-dimensional structure that is roughly L-shaped (Figure 17.15b). The loop extending from one end of the L includes the anticodon, the particular nucleotide triplet that base-pairs to a specific mRNA codon. From the other end of the L-shaped tRNA molecule protrudes its 3' end, which is the attachment site for an amino acid. Thus, the structure of a tRNA molecule fits its function.

    <text>How does recombination occur in bacteria?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Although new mutations are a major source of variation in prokaryotic populations, additional diversity arises from genetic recombination, the combining of DNA from two sources. In eukaryotes, the sexual processes of meiosis and fertilization combine DNA from two individuals in a single zygote. But meiosis and fertilization do not occur in prokaryotes. Instead, three other mechanisms: transformation, transduction, and conjugation: can bring together prokaryotic DNA from different individuals (that is, cells). When the individuals are members of different species, this movement of genes from one organism to another is called horizontal gene transfer. Although scientists have found evidence that each of these mechanisms can transfer DNA within and between species in both domain Bacteria and domain Archaea, to date most of our knowledge comes from research on bacteria.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>In transformation, the genotype and possibly phenotype of a prokaryotic cell are altered by the uptake of foreign DNA from its surroundings. For example, a harmless strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae can be transformed into pneumonia-causing cells if the cells are placed in a medium containing DNA from a pathogenic strain (see p. 306). This transformation occurs when a nonpathogenic cell takes up a piece of DNA carrying the allele for pathogenicity and replaces its own allele with the foreign allele, an exchange of homologous DNA segments. The cell is now a recombinant: Its chromosome contains DNA derived from two different cells. For many years after transformation was discovered in laboratory cultures, most biologists thought the process to be too rare and haphazard to play an important role in natural bacterial populations. But researchers have since learned that many bacteria have cell-surface proteins that recognize DNA from closely related species and transport it into the cell. 
Once inside the cell, the foreign DNA can be incorporated into the genome by homologous DNA exchange. Figure 27.11 Transduction. Phages may carry pieces of a bacterial chromosome from one cell (the donor) to another (the recipient). If recombination occurs after the transfer, genes from the donor may be incorporated into the recipient's genome. In transduction, phages (from "bacteriophages," the viruses that infect bacteria) carry prokaryotic genes from one host cell to another. In most cases, transduction results from accidents that occur during the phage replicative cycle (Figure 27.11). A virus that carries prokaryotic DNA may not be able to replicate because it lacks some or all of its own genetic material. However, the virus can attach to another prokaryotic cell (a recipient) and inject prokaryotic DNA acquired from the first cell (the donor). If some of this DNA is then incorporated into the recipient cell's chromosome by DNA recombination, a recombinant cell is formed.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 27.12 Bacterial. The E. coli donor cell (left) extends a pilus that attaches to a recipient cell, a key first step in the transfer of DNA. The pilus is a flexible tube of protein subunits (TEM). In a process called conjugation, DNA is transferred between two prokaryotic cells (usually of the same species) that are temporarily joined. In bacteria, the DNA transfer is always one-way: One cell donates the DNA, and the other receives it. The best-understood mechanism is that used by E. coli, and we will focus on this organism for the rest of this section. In E. coli, a pilus of the donor cell attaches to the recipient (Figure 27.12). The pilus then retracts, pulling the two cells together, much like a grappling hook. The next step is thought to be the formation of a temporary "mating bridge" between the two cells, through which the donor may transfer DNA to the recipient. This is an unsettled issue, however, and recent evidence indicates that DNA may pass directly through the pilus, 
which is hollow. In either case, the ability to form pili and donate DNA during conjugation results from the presence of a particular piece of DNA called the F factor (F for fertility). The F factor of E. coli consists of about 25 genes, most required for the production of pili. The F factor can exist either as a plasmid or as a segment of DNA within the bacterial chromosome. The F Factor as a Plasmid Figure 27.13 Conjugation and recombination in E. coli. The DNA replication that accompanies transfer of an F plasmid or part of an Hfr bacterial chromosome is called rolling circle replication. In effect, the intact circular parental DNA strand "rolls" as its other strand peels off and a new complementary strand is synthesized. The F factor in its plasmid form is called the F plasmid. Cells containing the F plasmid, designated F+ cells, function as DNA donors during conjugation. Cells lacking the F factor, designated F-', function as DNA recipients during conjugation. The F+ condition is transferable in the 
sense that an F+ cell converts an F-' cell to F+ if a copy of the entire F+ plasmid is transferred (Figure 27.13a). The F Factor in the Chromosome Chromosomal genes can be transferred during conjugation when the donor cell's F factor is integrated into the chromosome. A cell with the F factor built into its chromosome is called an Hfr cell (for high frequency of recombination). Like an F+ cell, an Hfr cell functions as a donor during conjugation with an F-' cell (Figure 27.13b). When chromosomal DNA from an Hfr cell enters an F-' cell, homologous regions of the Hfr and F-' chromosomes may align, allowing segments of their DNA to be exchanged. This results in the production of a recombinant bacterium that has genes derived from two different cells: a new genetic variant on which evolution can act.</justification>

    <text>How is a lymphocyte activated?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Vertebrates are unique in having adaptive immunity in addition to innate immunity. The adaptive response relies on T cells and B cells, which are types of white blood cells called lymphocytes. Like all blood cells, lymphocytes originate from stem cells in the bone marrow. Some lymphocytes migrate from the bone marrow to the thymus, an organ in the thoracic cavity above the heart (see Figure 43.7). These lymphocytes mature into T cells. Lymphocytes that remain and mature in the bone marrow develop as B cells. (Lymphocytes of a third type remain in the blood and become the natural killer cells active in innate immunity. ) Any substance that elicits a response from a B cell or T cell is called an antigen. In adaptive immunity, recognition occurs when a B cell or T cell binds to an antigen, such as a bacterial or viral protein, via a protein called an antigen receptor. An antigen receptor is specific enough to bind to just one part of one molecule from a particular pathogen, such as a 
species of bacteria or strain of virus. Although the cells of the immune system produce millions of different antigen receptors, all of the antigen receptors made by a single B or T cell are identical. Infection by a virus, bacterium, or other pathogen triggers activation of B and T cells with antigen receptors specific for parts of that pathogen. B and T cells are shown here with only a few antigen receptors, but there are actually about 100,000 antigen receptors on the surface of a single B or T cell. Antigens are usually foreign and are typically large molecules, either proteins or polysaccharides. Many antigens protrude from the surface of foreign cells or viruses. Other antigens, such as toxins secreted by bacteria, are released into the extracellular fluid. The small, accessible portion of an antigen that binds to an antigen receptor is called an epitope, or antigenic determinant. An example is a group of amino acids in a particular protein. A single antigen usually has several different epitopes, each 
binding a receptor with a different specificity. Because all antigen receptors produced by a single B cell or T cell are identical, they bind to the same epitope. Each B cell or T cell thus displays specificity for a particular epitope, enabling it to respond to any pathogen that produces molecules containing that same epitope. The antigen receptors of B cells and T cells have similar components, but they encounter antigens in different ways.</justification>

        <justification>To begin with, an antigen is presented to a steady stream of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes (see Figure 43.7) until a match is made. A successful match then triggers changes in cell number and activity for the lymphocyte to which an antigen has bound. The binding of an antigen receptor to an epitope initiates events that activate the lymphocyte. Once activated, a B cell or T cell undergoes multiple cell divisions. For each activated cell, the result of this proliferation is a clone, a population of cells that are identical to the original cell. Some cells from this clone become effector cells, short-lived cells that take effect immediately against the antigen and any pathogens producing that antigen. The effector forms of B cells are plasma cells, which secrete antibodies. The effector forms of T cells are helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, whose roles we'll explore in Concept 43.3. The remaining cells in the clone become memory cells, long-lived cells that can give rise to effector 
cells if the same antigen is encountered later in the animal's life. Figure 43.14 Clonal selection. This figure illustrates clonal selection, using B cells as an example. In response to a specific antigen and to immune cell signals (not shown), one B cell divides and forms a clone of cells. The remaining B cells, which have antigen receptors specific for other antigens, do not respond. The clone of cells formed by the selected B cell gives rise to memory B cells and antibody-secreting plasma cells. T cells also undergo clonal selection, generating memory T cells and effector T cells (cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells). Figure 43.14 summarizes the proliferation of a lymphocyte into a clone of cells in response to binding to an antigen, using B cells as an example. This process is called clonal selection because an encounter with an antigen selects which lymphocyte will divide to produce a clonal population of thousands of cells specific for a particular epitope.</justification>

        <justification>43.2 In adaptive immunity, receptors provide pathogen-specific recognition (pp. 935-940) Adaptive immunity relies on lymphocytes that arise from stem cells in the bone marrow and complete their maturation in the bone marrow (B cells) or in the thymus (T cells). Lymphocytes have cell-surface antigen receptors for foreign molecules. All receptor proteins on a single B or T cell are the same, but there are millions of B and T cells in the body that differ in the foreign molecules that their receptors recognize. Upon infection, B and T cells specific for the pathogen are activated. Some T cells help other lymphocytes; others kill infected host cells. B cells called plasma cells produce soluble receptor proteins called antibodies, which bind to foreign molecules and cells. The activated lymphocytes called memory cells defend against future infections by the same pathogen. Recognition of foreign molecules involves the binding of variable regions of receptors to an epitope, a small region of 
an antigen. B cells and antibodies recognize epitopes on the surface of antigens circulating in the blood or lymph. T cells recognize protein epitopes in small antigen fragments (peptides) that are presented on the surface of host cells, complexed with cell-surface proteins called MHC (major histocompatibility complex) molecules. The four major characteristics of B and T cell development are the generation of cell diversity, self-tolerance, proliferation, and immunological memory.</justification>

        <justification>43.3 Adaptive immunity defends against infection of body fluids and body cells (pp. 940-946) Helper T cells interact with antigen fragments displayed by class II MHC molecules on the surface of dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells (antigen-presenting cells). Activated helper T cells secrete cytokines that stimulate other lymphocytes as part of the response to nearly all antigens. Cytotoxic T cells bind to a complex of an antigen fragment and a class I MHC molecule on infected host cells. In the cell-mediated immune response, activated cytotoxic T cells secrete proteins that initiate destruction of infected cells. All T cells have an accessory protein that enhances binding to MHC-antigen fragment complexes. In the humoral immune response, B cell antigen receptors and antibodies bind to extracellular foreign substances in blood and lymph. The binding of antibodies helps eliminate antigens by phagocytosis and complement-mediated lysis. The five major antibody classes differ in 
distribution and function. Active immunity develops in response to infection or to immunization with a nonpathogenic form or part of a pathogen. Active immunity includes a response to and immunological memory for that pathogen.</justification>

    <text>How do cells avoid coming to equilibrium?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Like most systems, a living cell is not in equilibrium. The constant flow of materials in and out of the cell keeps the metabolic pathways from ever reaching equilibrium, and the cell continues to do work throughout its life. This principle is illustrated by the open (and more realistic) hydroelectric system in Figure 8.7b. However, unlike this simple single-step system, a catabolic pathway in a cell releases free energy in a series of reactions. An example is cellular respiration, illustrated by analogy in Figure 8.7c. Some of the reversible reactions of respiration are constantly "pulled" in one direction: that is, they are kept out of equilibrium. The key to maintaining this lack of equilibrium is that the product of a reaction does not accumulate but instead becomes a reactant in the next step; finally, waste products are expelled from the cell. The overall sequence of reactions is kept going by the huge free-energy difference between glucose and oxygen at the top of the energy "
hill" and carbon dioxide and water at the "downhill" end. As long as our cells have a steady supply of glucose or other fuels and oxygen and are able to expel waste products to the surroundings, their metabolic pathways never reach equilibrium and can continue to do the work of life.</justification>

        <justification>Transcription is the synthesis of RNA using information in the DNA. The two nucleic acids are written in different forms of the same language, and the information is simply transcribed, or "rewritten," from DNA to RNA. Just as a DNA strand provides a template for making a new complementary strand during DNA replication, it also can serve as a template for assembling a complementary sequence of RNA nucleotides. For a protein-coding gene, the resulting RNA molecule is a faithful transcript of the gene's protein-building instructions. This type of RNA molecule is called messenger RNA (mRNA) because it carries a genetic message from the DNA to the protein-synthesizing machinery of the cell.</justification>

        <justification>The series of words in a gene is transcribed into a complementary series of nonoverlapping, three-nucleotide words in mRNA, which is then translated into a chain of amino acids (Figure 17.4). During transcription, the gene determines the sequence of nucleotide bases along the length of the RNA molecule that is being synthesized. For each gene, only one of the two DNA strands is transcribed. This strand is called the template strand because it provides the pattern, or template, for the sequence of nucleotides in an RNA transcript. For any given gene, the same strand is used as the template every time the gene is transcribed. For other genes on the same DNA molecule, however, the opposite strand may be the one that always functions as the template. An mRNA molecule is complementary rather than identical to its DNA template because RNA nucleotides are assembled on the template according to base-pairing rules (see Figure 17.4).

        <justification>In the example in Figure 17.4, the nucleotide triplet ACC along the DNA (written as 3'-ACC-5') provides a template for 5'-UGG-3' in the mRNA molecule. The mRNA nucleotide triplets are called codons, and they are customarily written in the 5' &amp;rarr; 3' direction. In our example, UGG is the codon for the amino acid tryptophan (abbreviated Trp). The term codon is also used for the DNA nucleotide triplets along the nontemplate strand. These codons are complementary to the template strand and thus identical in sequence to the mRNA, except that they have T instead of U. (For this reason, the nontemplate DNA strand is sometimes called the "coding strand. ")</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>In a particular environment, RNA molecules with certain base sequences are more stable and replicate faster and with fewer errors than other sequences. The RNA molecule whose sequence is best suited to the surrounding environment and has the greatest ability to replicate itself will leave the most descendant molecules. Occasionally, a copying error will result in a molecule that folds into a shape that is even more stable or more adept at self-replication than the ancestral sequence. Similar selection events may have occurred on early Earth. Thus, the molecular biology of today may have been preceded by an "RNA world," in which small RNA molecules that carried genetic information were able to replicate and to store information about the vesicles that carried them.</justification>

    <text>How do malignant tumor cells spread?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 12.20 The growth and metastasis of a malignant breast tumor. The cells of malignant (cancerous) tumors grow in an uncontrolled way and can spread to neighboring tissues and, via lymph and blood vessels, to other parts of the body. The spread of cancer cells beyond their original site is called metastasis. The abnormal behavior of cancer cells can be catastrophic when it occurs in the body. The problem begins when a single cell in a tissue undergoes transformation, the process that converts a normal cell to a cancer cell. The body's immune system normally recognizes a transformed cell as an insurgent and destroys it. However, if the cell evades destruction, it may proliferate and form a tumor, a mass of abnormal cells within otherwise normal tissue. The abnormal cells may remain at the original site if they have too few genetic and cellular changes to survive at another site. In that case, the tumor is called a benign tumor. Most benign tumors do not cause serious problems and 
can be completely removed by surgery. In contrast, a malignant tumor includes cells whose genetic and cellular changes enable them to spread to new tissues and impair the functions of one or more organs. An individual with a malignant tumor is said to have cancer; Figure 12.20 shows the development of breast cancer. The changes that have occurred in cells of malignant tumors show up in many ways besides excessive proliferation. These cells may have unusual numbers of chromosomes, though whether this is a cause or an effect of transformation is a current topic of debate. Their metabolism may be disabled, and they may cease to function in any constructive way. Abnormal changes on the cell surface cause cancer cells to lose attachments to neighboring cells and the extracellular matrix, allowing them to spread into nearby tissues. Cancer cells may also secrete signaling molecules that cause blood vessels to grow toward the tumor. A few tumor cells may separate from the original tumor, enter blood vessels and 
lymph vessels, and travel to other parts of the body. There, they may proliferate and form a new tumor. This spread of cancer cells to locations distant from their original site is called metastasis (see Figure 12.20).</justification>

        <justification>The model of a multistep path to cancer is well supported by studies of one of the best-understood types of human cancer, colorectal cancer. About 135,000 new cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and the disease causes 60,000 deaths each year. Like most cancers, colorectal cancer develops gradually (Figure 18.25). The first sign is often a polyp, a small, benign growth in the colon lining. The cells of the polyp look normal, although they divide unusually frequently. The tumor grows and may eventually become malignant, invading other tissues. The development of a malignant tumor is paralleled by a gradual accumulation of mutations that convert proto-oncogenes to oncogenes and knock out tumor-suppressor genes. A ras oncogene and a mutated p53 tumor-suppressor gene are often involved. About half a dozen changes must occur at the DNA level for a cell to become fully cancerous. These changes usually include the appearance of at least one active oncogene 
and the mutation or loss of several tumor-suppressor genes. Furthermore, since mutant tumor-suppressor alleles are usually recessive, in most cases mutations must knock out both alleles in a cell's genome to block tumor suppression. (Most oncogenes, on the other hand, behave as dominant alleles. ) The order in which these changes must occur is still under investigation, as is the relative importance of different mutations.</justification>

        <justification>Around 1857, Mendel began breeding garden peas in the abbey garden to study inheritance. Although the question of heredity had long been a focus of curiosity at the monastery, Mendel's fresh approach allowed him to deduce principles that had remained elusive to others. One reason Mendel probably chose to work with peas is that they are available in many varieties. For example, one variety has purple flowers, while another variety has white flowers. A heritable feature that varies among individuals, such as flower color, is called a character. Each variant for a character, such as purple or white color for flowers, is called a trait. Other advantages of using peas are their short generation time and the large number of offspring from each mating. Furthermore, Mendel could strictly control mating between plants.</justification>

        <justification>In nature, pea plants usually self-fertilize: Pollen grains from the stamens land on the carpel of the same flower, and sperm released from the pollen grains fertilize eggs present in the carpel. To achieve cross-pollination (fertilization between different plants), Mendel removed the immature stamens of a plant before they produced pollen and then dusted pollen from another plant onto the altered flowers (Figure 14.2). Each resulting zygote then developed into a plant embryo encased in a seed (pea). Mendel could thus always be sure of the parentage of new seeds.</justification>

        <justification>In a typical breeding experiment, Mendel cross-pollinated two contrasting, true-breeding pea varieties: for example, purple-flowered plants and white-flowered plants (see Figure 14.2). This mating, or crossing, of two true-breeding varieties is called hybridization. The true-breeding parents are referred to as the P generation (parental generation), and their hybrid offspring are the F1 generation (first filial generation, the word filial from the Latin word for "son"). Allowing these F1 hybrids to self-pollinate (or to cross-pollinate with other F1 hybrids) produces an F2 generation (second filial generation). Mendel usually followed traits for at least the P, F1, and F2 generations. Had Mendel stopped his experiments with the F1 generation, the basic patterns of inheritance would have escaped him. Mendel's quantitative analysis of the F2 plants from thousands of genetic crosses like these allowed him to deduce two fundamental principles of heredity, which have come to be called the 
law of segregation and the law of independent assortment.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>If the blending model of inheritance were correct, the F1 hybrids from a cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered pea plants would have pale purple flowers, a trait intermediate between those of the P generation. Notice in Figure 14.2 that the experiment produced a very different result: All the F1 offspring had flowers just as purple as the purple-flowered parents. What happened to the white-flowered plants' genetic contribution to the hybrids? If it were lost, then the F1 plants could produce only purple-flowered offspring in the F2 generation. But when Mendel allowed the F1 plants to self-pollinate and planted their seeds, the white-flower trait reappeared in the F2 generation. Mendel used very large sample sizes and kept accurate records of his results: 705 of the F2 plants had purple flowers, and 224 had white flowers. These data fit a ratio of approximately three purple to one white (Figure 14.3). Mendel reasoned that the heritable factor for white flowers did not 
disappear in the F1 plants, but was somehow hidden, or masked, when the purple-flower factor was present. In Mendel's terminology, purple flower color is a dominant trait, and white flower color is a recessive trait. The reappearance of white-flowered plants in the F2 generation was evidence that the heritable factor causing white flowers had not been diluted or destroyed by coexisting with the purple-flower factor in the F1 hybrids.</justification>

We refer to a cross between such heterozygotes as a monohybrid cross. Mendel identified his second law of inheritance by following two characters at the same time, such as seed color and seed shape. Seeds (peas) may be either yellow or green. They also may be either round (smooth) or wrinkled. From single-character crosses, Mendel knew that the allele for yellow seeds is dominant (Y), and the allele for green seeds is recessive (y).</justification>

        <justification>Another term that describes a state of maximum stability is equilibrium, which you learned about in Chapter 2 in connection with chemical reactions. There is an important relationship between free energy and equilibrium, including chemical equilibrium. Recall that most chemical reactions are reversible and proceed to a point at which the forward and backward reactions occur at the same rate. The reaction is then said to be at chemical equilibrium, and there is no further net change in the relative concentration of products and reactants. As a reaction proceeds toward equilibrium, the free energy of the mixture of reactants and products decreases. Free energy increases when a reaction is somehow pushed away from equilibrium, perhaps by removing some of the products (and thus changing their concentration relative to that of the reactants). For a system at equilibrium, G is at its lowest possible value in that system.</justification>

        <justification>An organism's heritable traits can influence not only its own performance, but also how well its offspring cope with environmental challenges. For example, an organism might have a trait that gives its offspring an advantage in escaping predators, obtaining food, or tolerating physical conditions. When such advantages increase the number of offspring that survive and reproduce, the traits that are favored will likely appear at a greater frequency in the next generation. Thus, over time, natural selection resulting from factors such as predators, lack of food, or adverse physical conditions can lead to an increase in the proportion of favorable traits in a population. How rapidly do such changes occur? Darwin reasoned that if artificial selection can bring about dramatic change in a relatively short period of time, then natural selection should be capable of substantial modification of species over many hundreds of generations. Even if the advantages of some heritable traits over others 
are slight, the advantageous variations will gradually accumulate in the population, and less favorable variations will diminish. Over time, this process will increase the frequency of individuals with favorable adaptations and hence refine the match between organisms and their environment (see Figure 1.20).</justification>

        <justification>Over time, natural selection can increase the match between organisms and their environment (Figure 22.12). If an environment changes, or if individuals move to a new environment, natural selection may result in adaptation to these new conditions, sometimes giving rise to new species. One subtle but important point is that although natural selection occurs through interactions between individual organisms and their environment, individuals do not evolve. Rather, it is the population that evolves over time. A second key point is that natural selection can amplify or diminish only those heritable traits that differ among the individuals in a population. Thus, even if a trait is heritable, if all the individuals in a population are genetically identical for that trait, evolution by natural selection cannot occur. Third, remember that environmental factors vary from place to place and over time. A trait that is favorable in one place or time may be useless: or even detrimental: in other 
places or times. Natural selection is always operating, but which traits are favored depends on the context in which a species lives and mates.</justification>

        <justification>Natural selection can alter the frequency distribution of heritable traits in three ways, depending on which phenotypes in a population are favored. These three modes of selection are called directional selection, disruptive selection, and stabilizing selection. Figure 23.13 Modes of selection. These cases describe three ways in which a hypothetical deer mouse population with heritable variation in fur coloration from light to dark might evolve. The graphs show how the frequencies of individuals with different fur colors change over time. The large white arrows symbolize selective pressures against certain phenotypes. Directional selection occurs when conditions favor individuals exhibiting one extreme of a phenotypic range, thereby shifting a population's frequency curve for the phenotypic character in one direction or the other (Figure 23.13a). Directional selection is common when a population's environment changes or when members of a population migrate to a new (and different) 
habitat. For instance, an increase in the size of seeds available as food led to an increase in beak depth in a population of Galapagos finches (see Figure 23.1). Disruptive selection (Figure 23.13b) occurs when conditions favor individuals at both extremes of a phenotypic range over individuals with intermediate phenotypes. One example is a population of black-bellied seedcracker finches in Cameroon whose members display two distinctly different beak sizes. Small-billed birds feed mainly on soft seeds, whereas large-billed birds specialize in cracking hard seeds. It appears that birds with intermediate-sized bills are relatively inefficient at cracking both types of seeds and thus have lower relative fitness. Stabilizing selection (Figure 23.13c) acts against both extreme phenotypes and favors intermediate variants. This mode of selection reduces variation and tends to maintain the status quo for a particular phenotypic character. For example, the birth weights of most human babies lie in the range of 3-4 
kg (6.6-8.8 pounds); babies who are either much smaller or much larger suffer higher rates of mortality. Regardless of the mode of selection, however, the basic mechanism remains the same. Selection favors individuals whose heritable phenotypic traits provide higher reproductive success than do the traits of other individuals.</justification>

Phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes an early step in glycolysis (see Figure 9.9), is one such enzyme. It is stimulated by AMP (derived from ADP) but is inhibited by ATP and by citrate.

      </answer>
      <answer>
        <justification>As shown in Figure 9.20, one important switch is phosphofructokinase, the enzyme that catalyzes step 3 of glycolysis (see Figure 9.9). That is the first step that commits the substrate irreversibly to the glycolytic pathway. By controlling the rate of this step, the cell can speed up or slow down the entire catabolic process. Phosphofructokinase can thus be considered the pacemaker of respiration. Phosphofructokinase is an allosteric enzyme with receptor sites for specific inhibitors and activators. It is inhibited by ATP and stimulated by AMP (adenosine monophosphate), which the cell derives from ADP. As ATP accumulates, inhibition of the enzyme slows down glycolysis. The enzyme becomes active again as cellular work converts ATP to ADP (and AMP) faster than ATP is being regenerated. Phosphofructokinase is also sensitive to citrate, the first product of the citric acid cycle. If citrate accumulates in mitochondria, some of it passes into the cytosol and inhibits phosphofructokinase. 
This mechanism helps synchronize the rates of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. As citrate accumulates, glycolysis slows down, and the supply of acetyl groups to the citric acid cycle decreases. If citrate consumption increases, either because of a demand for more ATP or because anabolic pathways are draining off intermediates of the citric acid cycle, glycolysis accelerates and meets the demand.

    <text>How does the gene for sickle cell anemia show heterozygote advantage?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>About one out of ten African-Americans have sickle-cell trait, an unusually high frequency of heterozygotes for an allele with severe detrimental effects in homozygotes. Why haven't evolutionary processes resulted in the disappearance of this allele among this population? One explanation is that having a single copy of the sickle-cell allele reduces the frequency and severity of malaria attacks, especially among young children. The malaria parasite spends part of its life cycle in red blood cells (see Figure 28.10), and the presence of even heterozygous amounts of sickle-cell hemoglobin results in lower parasite densities and hence reduced malaria symptoms. Thus, in tropical Africa, where infection with the malaria parasite is common, the sickle-cell allele confers an advantage to heterozygotes even though it is harmful in the homozygous state.</justification>

    <text>How can a bacterial cell regulate which genes get expressed?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Second, cells can adjust the production level of certain enzymes; that is, they can regulate the expression of the genes encoding the enzymes. If, in our example, the environment provides all the tryptophan the cell needs, the cell stops making the enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of tryptophan (Figure 18.2b). In this case, the control of enzyme production occurs at the level of transcription, the synthesis of messenger RNA coding for these enzymes. More generally, many genes of the bacterial genome are switched on or off by changes in the metabolic status of the cell. One basic mechanism for this control of gene expression in bacteria, described as the operon model, was discovered in 1961 by Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Let's see what an operon is and how it works, using the control of tryptophan synthesis as our first example.</justification>

        <justification>E. coli synthesizes the amino acid tryptophan from a precursor molecule in the multistep pathway shown in Figure 18.2. Each reaction in the pathway is catalyzed by a specific enzyme, and the five genes that code for the subunits of these enzymes are clustered together on the bacterial chromosome. A single promoter serves all five genes, which together constitute a transcription unit. (Recall from Chapter 17 that a promoter is a site where RNA polymerase can bind to DNA and begin transcription. ) Thus, transcription gives rise to one long mRNA molecule that codes for the five polypeptides making up the enzymes in the tryptophan pathway. The cell can translate this one mRNA into five separate polypeptides because the mRNA is punctuated with start and stop codons that signal where the coding sequence for each polypeptide begins and ends. Figure 18.3 The trp operon in E. coli: regulated synthesis of repressible enzymes. Tryptophan is an amino acid produced by an anabolic pathway catalyzed 
by repressible enzymes. (a) The five genes encoding the polypeptide subunits of the enzymes in this pathway (see Figure 18.2) are grouped, along with a promoter, into the trp operon. The trp operator (the repressor binding site) is located within the trp promoter (the RNA polymerase binding site). (b) Accumulation of tryptophan, the end product of the pathway, represses transcription of the trp operon, thus blocking synthesis of all the enzymes in the pathway and shutting down tryptophan production.</justification>

        <justification>A key advantage of grouping genes of related function into one transcription unit is that a single "on-off switch" can control the whole cluster of functionally related genes; in other words, these genes are coordinately controlled. When an E. coli cell must make tryptophan for itself because the nutrient medium lacks this amino acid, all the enzymes for the metabolic pathway are synthesized at one time. The switch is a segment of DNA called an operator. Both its location and name suit its function: Positioned within the promoter or, in some cases, between the promoter and the enzyme-coding genes, the operator controls the access of RNA polymerase to the genes. All together, the operator, the promoter, and the genes they control: the entire stretch of DNA required for enzyme production for the tryptophan pathway: constitute an operon. The trp operon (trp for tryptophan) is one of many operons in the E. coli genome (Figure 18.3). If the operator is the operon's switch for controlling 
transcription, how does this switch work? By itself, the trp operon is turned on; that is, RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter and transcribe the genes of the operon. The operon can be switched off by a protein called the trp repressor. The repressor binds to the operator and blocks attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter, preventing transcription of the genes. A repressor protein is specific for the operator of a particular operon.</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>A second photosynthetic adaptation to arid conditions has evolved in many succulent (water-storing) plants, numerous cacti, pineapples, and representatives of several other plant families. These plants open their stomata during the night and close them during the day, just the reverse of how other plants behave. Closing stomata during the day helps desert plants conserve water, but it also prevents CO2 from entering the leaves. During the night, when their stomata are open, these plants take up CO2 and incorporate it into a variety of organic acids. This mode of carbon fixation is called crassulacean acid metabolism, or CAM, after the plant family Crassulaceae, the succulents in which the process was first discovered. The mesophyll cells of CAM plants store the organic acids they make during the night in their vacuoles until morning, when the stomata close. During the day, when the light reactions can supply ATP and NADPH for the Calvin cycle, CO2 is released from the organic acids 
made the night before to become incorporated into sugar in the chloroplasts.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 13.11 The results of crossing over during meiosis. As a consequence of the independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis, each of us produces a collection of gametes differing greatly in their combinations of the chromosomes we inherited from our two parents. Figure 13.10 suggests that each chromosome in a gamete is exclusively maternal or paternal in origin. In fact, this is not the case, because crossing over produces recombinant chromosomes, individual chromosomes that carry genes (DNA) derived from two different parents (Figure 13.11). In meiosis in humans, an average of one to three crossover events occur per chromosome pair, depending on the size of the chromosomes and the position of their centromeres. Crossing over begins very early in prophase I as homologous chromosomes pair loosely along their lengths. Each gene on one homolog is aligned precisely with the corresponding gene on the other homolog. In a single crossover event, the DNA of two nonsister chromatids: 
one maternal and one paternal chromatid of a homologous pair: is broken by specific proteins at precisely corresponding points, and the two segments beyond the crossover point are each joined to the other chromatid. Thus, a paternal chromatid is joined to a piece of maternal chromatid beyond the crossover point, and vice versa. In this way, crossing over produces chromosomes with new combinations of maternal and paternal alleles (see Figure 13.11).</justification>

        <justification>In the cell-mediated immune response, cytotoxic T cells are the effector cells. The term cytotoxic refers to their use of toxic gene products to kill infected cells. To become active, they require signaling molecules from helper T cells as well as interaction with a cell that presents an antigen. Once activated, cytotoxic T cells can eliminate cells that are infected by viruses or other intracellular pathogens. Figure 43.17 The killing action of cytotoxic T cells on an infected host cell. An activated cytotoxic T cell releases molecules that make pores in an infected cell's membrane and enzymes that break down proteins, promoting the cell's death. Fragments of foreign proteins produced in infected host cells associate with class I MHC molecules and are displayed on the cell surface, where they can be recognized by cytotoxic T cells (Figure 43.17). As with helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells have an accessory protein that binds to the MHC molecule, helping keep the two cells in contact 
while the T cell is activated. The targeted destruction of an infected host cell by a cytotoxic T cell involves the secretion of proteins that disrupt membrane integrity and trigger apoptosis (see Figure 43.17). The death of the infected cell not only deprives the pathogen of a place to reproduce, but also exposes cell contents to circulating antibodies, which mark them for disposal. After destroying an infected cell, the cytotoxic T cell can move on and kill other cells infected with the same pathogen.</justification>

        <justification>In vertebrates, the hypothalamus plays a central role in integrating the endocrine and nervous systems. One of several endocrine glands located in the brain (Figure 45.14), the hypothalamus receives information from nerves throughout the body, including the brain. In response, the hypothalamus initiates endocrine signaling appropriate to environmental conditions. In many vertebrates, for example, nerve signals from the brain pass sensory information to the hypothalamus about seasonal changes. The hypothalamus, in turn, regulates the release of reproductive hormones required during the breeding season. Signals from the hypothalamus travel to the pituitary gland, a gland located at its base (see Figure 45.14). Roughly the size and shape of a lima bean, the pituitary has discrete posterior and anterior parts, or lobes, that secrete different sets of hormones.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Endocrine signals generated by the hypothalamus regulate hormone secretion by the anterior pituitary (Figure 45.16). Each hypothalamic hormone is either a releasing hormone or an inhibiting hormone, reflecting its role in promoting or inhibiting release of one or more specific hormones by the anterior pituitary. Prolactin-releasing hormone, for example, is a hypothalamic hormone that stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete prolactin, which has activities that include stimulating milk production. Every anterior pituitary hormone is controlled by at least one releasing hormone. Some, such as prolactin, have both a releasing hormone and an inhibiting hormone. The hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones are secreted near capillaries at the base of the hypothalamus. The capillaries drain into short blood vessels, called portal vessels, which subdivide into a second capillary bed within the anterior pituitary. In this way, the releasing and inhibiting hormones have direct access 
to the gland they control. Hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary regulate a diverse set of processes in the human body, including metabolism, osmoregulation, and reproductive activity.</justification>

        <justification>In this example, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis is used to drive an endergonic process: the cellular synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid and ammonia. For example, with the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to use the energy released by ATP hydrolysis directly to drive chemical reactions that, by themselves, are endergonic. If the deltaG of an endergonic reaction is less than the amount of energy released by ATP hydrolysis, then the two reactions can be coupled so that, overall, the coupled reactions are exergonic (Figure 8.9). This usually involves the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to some other molecule, such as the reactant. The recipient with the phosphate group covalently bonded to it is then called a phosphorylated intermediate. The key to coupling exergonic and endergonic reactions is the formation of this phosphorylated intermediate, which is more reactive (less stable) than the original unphosphorylated molecule.</justification>

The free energy required to phosphorylate ADP comes from exergonic breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell.

        <justification>Although carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be processed and consumed as fuel, it is helpful to learn the steps of cellular respiration by tracking the degradation of the sugar glucose (C6H12O6): C6H12O6 + 6 O2 &amp;rarr; 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + Energy (ATP + heat) Glucose is the fuel that cells most often use; we will discuss other organic molecules contained in foods later in the chapter. This breakdown of glucose is exergonic, having a free-energy change of -'686 kcal (2,870 kJ) per mole of glucose decomposed (deltaG = -'686 kcal/mol). Recall that a negative deltaG indicates that the products of the chemical process store less energy than the reactants and that the reaction can happen spontaneously: in other words, without an input of energy. Catabolic pathways do not directly move flagella, pump solutes across membranes, polymerize monomers, or perform other cellular work. Catabolism is linked to work by a chemical drive shaft: ATP, which you learned about in Chapter 8. To keep 
working, the cell must regenerate its supply of ATP from ADP andi (see Figure 8.11). To understand how cellular respiration accomplishes this, let's examine the fundamental chemical processes known as oxidation and reduction.</justification>

        <justification>But the energy-yielding redox process of greatest interest to biologists is respiration: the oxidation of glucose and other molecules in food. Examine again the summary equation for cellular respiration, but this time think of it as a redox process: As in the combustion of methane or gasoline, the fuel (glucose) is oxidized and oxygen is reduced. The electrons lose potential energy along the way, and energy is released. In general, organic molecules that have an abundance of hydrogen are excellent fuels because their bonds are a source of "hilltop" electrons, whose energy may be released as these electrons "fall" down an energy gradient when they are transferred to oxygen. The summary equation for respiration indicates that hydrogen is transferred from glucose to oxygen. But the important point, not visible in the summary equation, is that the energy state of the electron changes as hydrogen (with its electron) is transferred to oxygen. In respiration, the oxidation of glucose 
transfers electrons to a lower energy state, liberating energy that becomes available for ATP synthesis.</justification>

Figure 9.6 An overview of cellular respiration. During glycolysis, each glucose molecule is broken down into two molecules of the compound pyruvate. In eukaryotic cells, as shown here, the pyruvate enters the mitochondrion. There it is oxidized to acetyl CoA, which is further oxidized to CO2 in the citric acid cycle. NADH and a similar electron carrier, a coenzyme called FADH2, transfer electrons derived from glucose to electron transport chains, which are built into the inner mitochondrial membrane.

        <justification>Some of the steps of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are redox reactions in which dehydrogenases transfer electrons from substrates to NAD+, forming NADH. In the third stage of respiration, the electron transport chain accepts electrons from the breakdown products of the first two stages (most often via NADH) and passes these electrons from one molecule to another. At the end of the chain, the electrons are combined with molecular oxygen and hydrogen ions (H+), forming water (see Figure 9.5b). The energy released at each step of the chain is stored in a form the mitochondrion (or prokaryotic cell) can use to make ATP from ADP. This mode of ATP synthesis is called oxidative phosphorylation because it is powered by the redox reactions of the electron transport chain. Figure 9.7 Substrate-level phosphorylation. Some ATP is made by direct transfer of a phosphate group from an organic substrate to ADP by an enzyme. (For examples in glycolysis, see Figure 9.9, steps 7 and 10. )</justification>

        <justification>Some of the reversible reactions of respiration are constantly "pulled" in one direction: that is, they are kept out of equilibrium. The key to maintaining this lack of equilibrium is that the product of a reaction does not accumulate but instead becomes a reactant in the next step; finally, waste products are expelled from the cell. The overall sequence of reactions is kept going by the huge free-energy difference between glucose and oxygen at the top of the energy "hill" and carbon dioxide and water at the "downhill" end.</justification>

    <text>How are genes expressed?</text>

      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 18.1 What regulates the precise pattern of gene expression in the developing wing of a fly embryo? An adult fruit fly, for example, develops from a single fertilized egg, passing through a wormlike stage called a larva. At every stage, gene expression is carefully regulated, ensuring that the right genes are expressed only at the correct time and place. In the larva, the adult wing forms in a disk-shaped pocket of several thousand cells, shown in Figure 18.1. The tissue in this image has been treated to reveal the mRNA for three genes: labeled red, blue, and green: using techniques covered in Chapter 20. (Red and green together appear yellow. ) The intricate pattern of expression for each gene is the same from larva to larva at this stage, and it provides a graphic display of the precision of gene regulation. But what is the molecular basis for this pattern? Why is one particular gene expressed only in the few hundred cells that appear blue in this image and not in the other 
cells? In this chapter, we first explore how bacteria regulate expression of their genes in response to different environmental conditions. We then examine how eukaryotes regulate gene expression to maintain different cell types. Gene expression in eukaryotes, as in bacteria, is often regulated at the stage of transcription, but control at other stages is also important.</justification>

        <justification>All organisms, whether prokaryotes or eukaryotes, must regulate which genes are expressed at any given time. Both unicellular organisms and the cells of multicellular organisms must continually turn genes on and off in response to signals from their external and internal environments. Regulation of gene expression is also essential for cell specialization in multicellular organisms, which are made up of different types of cells, each with a distinct role. To perform its role, each cell type must maintain a specific program of gene expression in which certain genes are expressed and others are not.</justification>

        <justification>The specific transcription factors made in a cell determine which genes are expressed. In this example, the genes for albumin and crystallin are shown at the top, each with an enhancer made up of three different control elements. Although the enhancers for the two genes share one control element (gray), each enhancer has a unique combination of elements. All the activators required for high-level expression of the albumin gene are present only in liver cells (a), whereas the activators needed for expression of the crystallin gene are present only in lens cells (b). For simplicity, we consider only the role of activators here, although the presence or absence of repressors may also influence transcription in certain cell types. Even with only a dozen control element sequences available, a very large number of combinations are possible. A particular combination of control elements will be able to activate transcription only when the appropriate activator proteins are present, which may 
occur at a precise time during development or in a particular cell type. Figure 18.11 illustrates how the use of different combinations of just a few control elements can allow differential regulation of transcription in two cell types. This can occur because each cell type contains a different group of activator proteins. How these groups came to differ will be explored in Concept 18.4.</justification>

        <justification>How does the eukaryotic cell deal with genes of related function that need to be turned on or off at the same time? Earlier in this chapter, you learned that in bacteria, such coordinately controlled genes are often clustered into an operon, which is regulated by a single promoter and transcribed into a single mRNA molecule. Thus, the genes are expressed together, and the encoded proteins are produced concurrently. With a few minor exceptions, operons that work in this way have not been found in eukaryotic cells. Co-expressed eukaryotic genes, such as genes coding for the enzymes of a metabolic pathway, are typically scattered over different chromosomes. In these cases, coordinate gene expression depends on the association of a specific combination of control elements with every gene of a dispersed group. The presence of these elements can be compared to the raised flags on a few mailboxes out of many, signaling to the mail carrier to check those boxes. Copies of the activators that 
recognize the control elements bind to them, promoting simultaneous transcription of the genes, no matter where they are in the genome. Coordinate control of dispersed genes in a eukaryotic cell often occurs in response to chemical signals from outside the cell. A steroid hormone, for example, enters a cell and binds to a specific intracellular receptor protein, forming a hormone-receptor complex that serves as a transcription activator (see Figure 11.9). Every gene whose transcription is stimulated by a particular steroid hormone, regardless of its chromosomal location, has a control element recognized by that hormone-receptor complex. This is how estrogen activates a group of genes that stimulate cell division in uterine cells, preparing the uterus for pregnancy. Many signaling molecules, such as nonsteroid hormones and growth factors, bind to receptors on a cell's surface and never actually enter the cell. Such molecules can control gene expression indirectly by triggering signal transduction pathways 
that lead to activation of particular transcription activators or repressors (see Figure 11.15). Coordinate regulation in such pathways is the same as for steroid hormones: Genes with the same control elements are activated by the same chemical signals.</justification>

        <justification>What genetic attributes allow humans (and other vertebrates) to get by with no more genes than nematodes? An important factor is that vertebrate genomes "get more bang for the buck" from their coding sequences because of extensive alternative splicing of RNA transcripts. Recall that this process generates more than one functional protein from a single gene (see Figure 18.13). A typical human gene contains about ten exons, and an estimated 93% or so of these multi-exon genes are spliced in at least two different ways. Some genes are expressed in hundreds of alternatively spliced forms, others in just two. It is not yet possible to catalog all of the different forms, but it is clear that the number of different proteins encoded in the human genome far exceeds the proposed number of genes.</justification>

When considering phenotypes, however, it is often useful to start by focusing on genes that code for polypeptides. In this chapter, you have learned in molecular terms how a typical gene is expressed: by transcription into RNA and then translation into a polypeptide that forms a protein of specific structure and function. Proteins, in turn, bring about an organism's observable phenotype. A given type of cell expresses only a subset of its genes.</justification>

        <justification>Genes are typically hundreds or thousands of nucleotides long, each gene having a specific sequence of nucleotides. Each polypeptide of a protein also has monomers arranged in a particular linear order (the protein's primary structure), but its monomers are amino acids. Thus, nucleic acids and proteins contain information written in two different chemical languages. Getting from DNA to protein requires two major stages: transcription and translation. Transcription is the synthesis of RNA using information in the DNA. The two nucleic acids are written in different forms of the same language, and the information is simply transcribed, or "rewritten," from DNA to RNA. Just as a DNA strand provides a template for making a new complementary strand during DNA replication, it also can serve as a template for assembling a complementary sequence of RNA nucleotides. For a protein-coding gene, the resulting RNA molecule is a faithful transcript of the gene's protein-building instructions. This 
type of RNA molecule is called messenger RNA (mRNA) because it carries a genetic message from the DNA to the protein-synthesizing machinery of the cell. (Transcription is the general term for the synthesis of any kind of RNA on a DNA template. Later, you will learn about some other types of RNA produced by transcription. ) Translation is the synthesis of a polypeptide using the information in the mRNA. During this stage, there is a change in language: The cell must translate the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule into the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. The sites of translation are ribosomes, complex particles that facilitate the orderly linking of amino acids into polypeptide chains. Transcription and translation occur in all organisms, both those that lack a membrane-bounded nucleus (bacteria and archaea) and those that have one (eukaryotes).</justification>

        <justification>The mechanism of termination differs between bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, transcription proceeds through a terminator sequence in the DNA. The transcribed terminator (an RNA sequence) functions as the termination signal, causing the polymerase to detach from the DNA and release the transcript, which requires no further modification before translation. In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase II transcribes a sequence on the DNA called the polyadenylation signal sequence, which codes for a polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) in the pre-mRNA. Then, at a point about 10-35 nucleotides downstream from the AAUAAA signal, proteins associated with the growing RNA transcript cut it free from the polymerase, releasing the pre-mRNA. The pre-mRNA then undergoes processing, the topic of the next section.</justification>

    <text>How does ATP usually transfer energy?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>ATP hydrolysis causes changes in the shapes and binding affinities of proteins. This can occur either (a) directly, by phosphorylation, as shown for a membrane protein carrying out active transport of a solute (see also Figure 7.18), or (b) indirectly, via noncovalent binding of ATP and its hydrolytic products, as is the case for motor proteins that move vesicles (and other organelles) along cytoskeletal "tracks" in the cell (see also Figure 6.21). Transport and mechanical work in the cell are also nearly always powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. In these cases, ATP hydrolysis leads to a change in a protein's shape and often its ability to bind another molecule. Sometimes this occurs via a phosphorylated intermediate, as seen for the transport protein in Figure 8.10a. In most instances of mechanical work involving motor proteins "walking" along cytoskeletal elements (Figure 8.10b), a cycle occurs in which ATP is first bound noncovalently to the motor protein. Next, ATP is hydrolyzed, 
releasing ADP and &amp;#9413;i. Another ATP molecule can then bind. At each stage, the motor protein changes its shape and ability to bind the cytoskeleton, resulting in movement of the protein along the cytoskeletal track.</justification>

        <justification>This diagram is a simplified representation of a typical signaling pathway that leads to the regulation of gene activity in the cell nucleus. The initial signaling molecule, a local regulator called a growth factor, triggers a phosphorylation cascade, as in Figure 11.10. (The ATP molecules and phosphate groups are not shown. ) Once phosphorylated, the last kinase in the sequence enters the nucleus and there activates a gene-regulating protein, a transcription factor. This protein stimulates transcription of a specific gene (or genes). The resulting mRNA then directs the synthesis of a particular protein in the cytoplasm. Many signaling pathways ultimately regulate protein synthesis, usually by turning specific genes on or off in the nucleus. Like an activated steroid receptor (see Figure 11.9), the final activated molecule in a signaling pathway may function as a transcription factor. Figure 11.15 shows an example in which a signaling pathway activates a transcription factor that turns 
a gene on: The response to the growth factor signal is transcription, the synthesis of mRNA, which will be translated in the cytoplasm into a specific protein.</justification>

        <justification>The life span of mRNA molecules in the cytoplasm is important in determining the pattern of protein synthesis in a cell. Bacterial mRNA molecules typically are degraded by enzymes within a few minutes of their synthesis. This short life span of mRNAs is one reason bacteria can change their patterns of protein synthesis so quickly in response to environmental changes. In contrast, mRNAs in multicellular eukaryotes typically survive for hours, days, or even weeks. For instance, the mRNAs for the hemoglobin polypeptides (alpha-globin and beta-globin) in developing red blood cells are unusually stable, and these long-lived mRNAs are translated repeatedly in these cells.</justification>

        <justification>Separation of homologs. At anaphase I of meiosis, the duplicated chromosomes of each homologous pair move toward opposite poles, but the sister chromatids of each duplicated chromosome remain attached. In anaphase of mitosis, by contrast, sister chromatids separate. How do sister chromatids stay together through meiosis I but separate from each other in meiosis II and mitosis? Sister chromatids are attached along their lengths by protein complexes called cohesins. In mitosis, this attachment lasts until the end of metaphase, when enzymes cleave the cohesins, freeing the sister chromatids to move to opposite poles of the cell. In meiosis, sister chromatid cohesion is released in two steps, one at the start of anaphase I and one at anaphase II. In metaphase I, homologs are held together by cohesion between sister chromatid arms in regions beyond points of crossing over, where stretches of sister chromatids now belong to different chromosomes. As shown in Figure 13.8, the combination of 
crossing over and sister chromatid cohesion along the arms results in the formation of a chiasma. Chiasmata hold homologs together as the spindle forms for the first meiotic division. At the onset of anaphase I, the release of cohesion along sister chromatid arms allows homologs to separate. At anaphase II, the release of sister chromatid cohesion at the centromeres allows the sister chromatids to separate. Thus, sister chromatid cohesion and crossing over, acting together, play an essential role in the lining up of chromosomes by homologous pairs at metaphase I. Meiosis I is called the reductional division because it halves the number of chromosome sets per cell: a reduction from two sets (the diploid state) to one set (the haploid state). During the second meiotic division, meiosis II (sometimes called the equational division), the sister chromatids separate, producing haploid daughter cells. The mechanism for separating sister chromatids is virtually identical in meiosis II and mitosis.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 18.15 Regulation of gene expression by miRNAs. Since 1993, a number of research studies have uncovered small single-stranded RNA molecules, called microRNAs (miRNAs), that are capable of binding to complementary sequences in mRNA molecules. The miRNAs are made from longer RNA precursors that fold back on themselves, forming one or more short double-stranded hairpin structures, each held together by hydrogen bonds (Figure 18.15). After each hairpin is cut away from the precursor, it is trimmed by an enzyme (fittingly called Dicer) into a short double-stranded fragment of about 22 nucleotide pairs. One of the two strands is degraded, while the other strand, which is the miRNA, forms a complex with one or more proteins; the miRNA allows the complex to bind to any mRNA molecule with 7-8 nucleotides of complementary sequence. The miRNA-protein complex then either degrades the target mRNA or blocks its translation. It has been estimated that expression of at least one-half of all 
human genes may be regulated by miRNAs, a remarkable figure given that the existence of miRNAs was unknown a mere two decades ago. A growing understanding of the miRNA pathway provided an explanation for a perplexing observation: Researchers had found that injecting double-stranded RNA molecules into a cell somehow turned off expression of a gene with the same sequence as the RNA. They called this experimental phenomenon RNA interference (RNAi).</justification>

Protruding from the outer surface of this envelope are viral glycoproteins that bind to specific receptor molecules on the surface of a host cell. Figure 19.7, on the next page, outlines the events in the replicative cycle of an enveloped virus with an RNA genome. Ribosomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the host cell make the protein parts of the envelope glycoproteins; cellular enzymes in the ER and Golgi apparatus then add the sugars. The resulting viral glycoproteins, embedded in host cell-derived membrane, are transported to the cell surface. In a process much like exocytosis, new viral capsids are wrapped in membrane as they bud from the cell. In other words, the viral envelope is derived from the host cell's plasma membrane, although some of the molecules of this membrane are specified by viral genes. The enveloped viruses are now free to infect other cells. This 
replicative cycle does not necessarily kill the host cell, in contrast to the lytic cycles of phages.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Many hormones elicit more than one type of response in the body. The effects brought about by a particular hormone can vary if target cells differ in the molecules that receive or produce the response to that hormone. Consider the effects of epinephrine in mediating the body's response to short-term stress (Figure 45.9). Epinephrine simultaneously triggers glycogen breakdown in the liver, increased blood flow to major skeletal muscles, and decreased blood flow to the digestive tract. These varied effects enhance the rapid reactions of the body in emergencies. Tissues vary in their response to epinephrine because they vary in their receptors or in their signal transduction pathways. Target cell recognition of epinephrine involves G protein-coupled receptors. Liver cells have a beta-type epinephrine receptor that activates the enzyme protein kinase A, which in turn regulates enzymes in glycogen metabolism (Figure 45.9a). In blood vessels supplying skeletal muscle, the same kinase 
activated by the same epinephrine receptor inactivates a muscle-specific enzyme. The result is smooth muscle relaxation and hence increased blood flow (Figure 45.9b). In contrast, intestinal blood vessels have an alpha-type epinephrine receptor (Figure 45.9c). Rather than activate protein kinase A, the alpha receptor triggers a distinct signaling pathway involving a different G protein and different enzymes. The result is smooth muscle contraction and restricted blood flow to the intestines. Lipid-soluble hormones often exert different effects on different target cells as well. For example, the estrogen that stimulates a bird's liver to synthesize the yolk protein vitellogenin also stimulates its reproductive system to synthesize proteins that form the egg white.</justification>

        <sentences>10</sentences>
      </answer>
      <answer>
        <justification>Enzymes use a variety of mechanisms that lower activation energy and speed up a reaction (see Figure 8.15, step &amp;#10114;). First, in reactions involving two or more reactants, the active site provides a template on which the substrates can come together in the proper orientation for a reaction to occur between them. Second, as the active site of an enzyme clutches the bound substrates, the enzyme may stretch the substrate molecules toward their transition-state form, stressing and bending critical chemical bonds that must be broken during the reaction. Because EA is proportional to the difficulty of breaking the bonds, distorting the substrate helps it approach the transition state and thus reduces the amount of free energy that must be absorbed to achieve that state. Third, the active site may also provide a microenvironment that is more conducive to a particular type of reaction than the solution itself would be without the enzyme. For example, if the active site has amino acids 
with acidic R groups, the active site may be a pocket of low pH in an otherwise neutral cell. In such cases, an acidic amino acid may facilitate H+ transfer to the substrate as a key step in catalyzing the reaction. A fourth mechanism of catalysis is the direct participation of the active site in the chemical reaction. Sometimes this process even involves brief covalent bonding between the substrate and the side chain of an amino acid of the enzyme. Subsequent steps of the reaction restore the side chains to their original states, so that the active site is the same after the reaction as it was before.</justification>

The cofactors of some enzymes are inorganic, such as the metal atoms zinc, iron, and copper in ionic form. If the cofactor is an organic molecule, it is more specifically called a coenzyme. Most vitamins are important in nutrition because they act as coenzymes or raw materials from which coenzymes are made.

    <text>How do the charges on DNA and histones aid in chromosome condensation?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>In addition to acetylation, histones can undergo several other types of modifications that also help determine the chromatin configuration in a region. There is abundant evidence that chemical modifications to histones, the proteins around which the DNA is wrapped in nucleosomes, play a direct role in the regulation of gene transcription. The N-terminus of each histone molecule in a nucleosome protrudes outward from the nucleosome (Figure 18.7a). These histone tails are accessible to various modifying enzymes that catalyze the addition or removal of specific chemical groups. In histone acetylation, acetyl groups (: COCH3) are attached to lysines in histone tails; deacetylation is the removal of acetyl groups. When the lysines are acetylated, their positive charges are neutralized and the histone tails no longer bind to neighboring nucleosomes (Figure 18.7b). Such binding promotes the folding of chromatin into a more compact structure; when this binding does not occur, chromatin has a 
looser structure. As a result, transcription proteins have easier access to genes in an acetylated region. Researchers have shown that some enzymes that acetylate or deacetylate histones are closely associated with or even components of the transcription factors that bind to promoters (see Figure 17.8). These observations suggest that histone acetylation enzymes may promote the initiation of transcription not only by remodeling chromatin structure, but also by binding to and thus "recruiting" components of the transcription machinery. Other chemical groups, such as methyl and phosphate groups, can be reversibly attached to amino acids in histone tails. Addition of methyl groups (: CH3) to histone tails (histone methylation) can promote condensation of the chromatin, while addition of a phosphate group (phosphorylation) to an amino acid next to a methylated amino acid can have the opposite effect.</justification>

    <text>How does the mating of two heterozygous parents to produce an offspring with the recessive phenotype disprove the theory of blending inheritance?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>In a typical breeding experiment, Mendel cross-pollinated two contrasting, true-breeding pea varieties: for example, purple-flowered plants and white-flowered plants (see Figure 14.2). This mating, or crossing, of two true-breeding varieties is called hybridization. The true-breeding parents are referred to as the P generation (parental generation), and their hybrid offspring are the F1 generation (first filial generation, the word filial from the Latin word for "son"). Allowing these F1 hybrids to self-pollinate (or to cross-pollinate with other F1 hybrids) produces an F2 generation (second filial generation). Mendel usually followed traits for at least the P, F1, and F2 generations. Had Mendel stopped his experiments with the F1 generation, the basic patterns of inheritance would have escaped him. Mendel's quantitative analysis of the F2 plants from thousands of genetic crosses like these allowed him to deduce two fundamental principles of heredity, which have come to be called the 
law of segregation and the law of independent assortment.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>If the blending model of inheritance were correct, the F1 hybrids from a cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered pea plants would have pale purple flowers, a trait intermediate between those of the P generation. Notice in Figure 14.2 that the experiment produced a very different result: All the F1 offspring had flowers just as purple as the purple-flowered parents. What happened to the white-flowered plants' genetic contribution to the hybrids? If it were lost, then the F1 plants could produce only purple-flowered offspring in the F2 generation. But when Mendel allowed the F1 plants to self-pollinate and planted their seeds, the white-flower trait reappeared in the F2 generation. Mendel used very large sample sizes and kept accurate records of his results: 705 of the F2 plants had purple flowers, and 224 had white flowers. These data fit a ratio of approximately three purple to one white (Figure 14.3). Mendel reasoned that the heritable factor for white flowers did not 
disappear in the F1 plants, but was somehow hidden, or masked, when the purple-flower factor was present. In Mendel's terminology, purple flower color is a dominant trait, and white flower color is a recessive trait. The reappearance of white-flowered plants in the F2 generation was evidence that the heritable factor causing white flowers had not been diluted or destroyed by coexisting with the purple-flower factor in the F1 hybrids.</justification>

    <text>How are fats synthesized?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 5.10 The synthesis and structure of a fat, or triacylglycerol. The molecular building blocks of a fat are one molecule of glycerol and three molecules of fatty acids. (a) One water molecule is removed for each fatty acid joined to the glycerol. (b) A fat molecule with three fatty acid units, two of them identical. The carbons of the fatty acids are arranged zigzag to suggest the actual orientations of the four single bonds extending from each carbon (see Figure 4.3a). Although fats are not polymers, they are large molecules assembled from smaller molecules by dehydration reactions. A fat is constructed from two kinds of smaller molecules: glycerol and fatty acids (Figure 5.10a). Glycerol is an alcohol; each of its three carbons bears a hydroxyl group. A fatty acid has a long carbon skeleton, usually 16 or 18 carbon atoms in length. The carbon at one end of the skeleton is part of a carboxyl group, the functional group that gives these molecules the name fatty acid. The rest of 
the skeleton consists of a hydrocarbon chain. The relatively nonpolar C-H bonds in the hydrocarbon chains of fatty acids are the reason fats are hydrophobic. Fats separate from water because the water molecules hydrogen-bond to one another and exclude the fats. This is the reason that vegetable oil (a liquid fat) separates from the aqueous vinegar solution in a bottle of salad dressing. In making a fat, three fatty acid molecules are each joined to glycerol by an ester linkage, a bond between a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group. The resulting fat, also called a triacylglycerol, thus consists of three fatty acids linked to one glycerol molecule. (Still another name for a fat is triglyceride, a word often found in the list of ingredients on packaged foods. ) The fatty acids in a fat can be the same, or they can be of two or three different kinds, as in Figure 5.10b.</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Irrigation, particularly from groundwater, can also lead to soil salinization: the addition of salts to the soil that make it too salty for cultivating plants. Salts dissolved in irrigation water accumulate in the soil as the water evaporates, making the water potential of the soil solution more negative. The water potential gradient from soil to roots is reduced, diminishing water uptake (see Chapter 36). Many forms of irrigation, such as the flooding of fields, are wasteful because much of the water evaporates. To use water efficiently, farmers must understand the water-holding capacity of their soil, the water needs of their crops, and the appropriate irrigation technology. One popular technology is drip irrigation, the slow release of water to soil and plants from perforated plastic tubing placed directly at the root zone. Because drip irrigation requires less water and reduces salinization, it is used in many arid agricultural regions.</justification>

        <justification>What exactly happens when chlorophyll and other pigments absorb light? The colors corresponding to the absorbed wavelengths disappear from the spectrum of the transmitted and reflected light, but energy cannot disappear. When a molecule absorbs a photon of light, one of the molecule's electrons is elevated to an orbital where it has more potential energy. When the electron is in its normal orbital, the pigment molecule is said to be in its ground state. Absorption of a photon boosts an electron to an orbital of higher energy, and the pigment molecule is then said to be in an excited state. The only photons absorbed are those whose energy is exactly equal to the energy difference between the ground state and an excited state, and this energy difference varies from one kind of molecule to another. Thus, a particular compound absorbs only photons corresponding to specific wavelengths, which is why each pigment has a unique absorption spectrum.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>If a phospholipid bilayer was the main fabric of a membrane, where were the proteins located? Although the heads of phospholipids are hydrophilic, the surface of a pure phospholipid bilayer adheres less strongly to water than does the surface of a biological membrane. Given this difference, Hugh Davson and James Danielli suggested in 1935 that the membrane might be coated on both sides with hydrophilic proteins. They proposed a sandwich model: a phospholipid bilayer between two layers of proteins. When researchers first used electron microscopes to study cells in the 1950s, the pictures seemed to support the Davson-Danielli model. By the late 1960s, however, many cell biologists recognized two problems with the model. First, inspection of a variety of membranes revealed that membranes with different functions differ in structure and chemical composition. A second, more serious problem became apparent once membrane proteins were better characterized. Unlike proteins dissolved in the 
cytosol, membrane proteins are not very soluble in water because they are amphipathic. If such proteins were layered on the surface of the membrane, their hydrophobic parts would be in aqueous surroundings. Figure 7.3 The original fluid mosaic model for membranes. Taking these observations into account, S. J. Singer and G. Nicolson proposed in 1972 that membrane proteins reside in the phospholipid bilayer with their hydrophilic regions protruding (Figure 7.3). This molecular arrangement would maximize contact of hydrophilic regions of proteins and phospholipids with water in the cytosol and extracellular fluid, while providing their hydrophobic parts with a nonaqueous environment. In this fluid mosaic model, the membrane is a mosaic of protein molecules bobbing in a fluid bilayer of phospholipids.</justification>

When such a cell is immersed in a hypotonic solution: bathed in rainwater, for example: the wall helps maintain the cell's water balance. Consider a plant cell. Like an animal cell, the plant cell swells as water enters by osmosis (Figure 7.15b). However, the relatively inelastic wall will expand only so much before it exerts a back pressure on the cell, called turgor pressure, that opposes further water uptake. At this point, the cell is turgid (very firm), which is the healthy state for most plant cells.

    <text>How do organic molecules contain chemical energy?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>In general, organic molecules that have an abundance of hydrogen are excellent fuels because their bonds are a source of "hilltop" electrons, whose energy may be released as these electrons "fall" down an energy gradient when they are transferred to oxygen. The summary equation for respiration indicates that hydrogen is transferred from glucose to oxygen. But the important point, not visible in the summary equation, is that the energy state of the electron changes as hydrogen (with its electron) is transferred to oxygen. In respiration, the oxidation of glucose transfers electrons to a lower energy state, liberating energy that becomes available for ATP synthesis. The main energy-yielding foods, carbohydrates and fats, are reservoirs of electrons associated with hydrogen. Only the barrier of activation energy holds back the flood of electrons to a lower energy state (see Figure 8.12). Without this barrier, a food substance like glucose would combine almost instantaneously with O2. If 
we supply the activation energy by igniting glucose, it burns in air, releasing 686 kcal (2,870 kJ) of heat per mole of glucose (about 180 g). Body temperature is not high enough to initiate burning, of course. Instead, if you swallow some glucose, enzymes in your cells will lower the barrier of activation energy, allowing the sugar to be oxidized in a series of steps.</justification>

During a catabolic reaction, some bonds are broken and others formed, releasing energy and resulting in lower-energy breakdown products. This transformation also occurs, for example, in the engine of a car when the hydrocarbons of gasoline react explosively with oxygen, releasing the energy that pushes the pistons and producing exhaust. Although less explosive, a similar reaction of food molecules with oxygen provides chemical energy in biological systems, producing carbon dioxide and water as waste products.

        <justification>All of the molecules shown in Figures 4.3 and 4.5 are hydrocarbons, organic molecules consisting of only carbon and hydrogen. Atoms of hydrogen are attached to the carbon skeleton wherever electrons are available for covalent bonding. Hydrocarbons are the major components of petroleum, which is called a fossil fuel because it consists of the partially decomposed remains of organisms that lived millions of years ago. Figure 4.6 The role of hydrocarbons in fats. (a) Mammalian adipose cells stockpile fat molecules as a fuel reserve. This colorized TEM shows part of a human adipose cell with many fat droplets, each containing a large number of fat molecules. (b) A fat molecule consists of a small, nonhydrocarbon component joined to three hydrocarbon tails that account for the hydrophobic behavior of fats. The tails can be broken down to provide energy. (Black = carbon; gray = hydrogen; red = oxygen. ) Although hydrocarbons are not prevalent in most living organisms, many of a cell's 
organic molecules have regions consisting of only carbon and hydrogen. For example, the molecules known as fats have long hydrocarbon tails attached to a nonhydrocarbon component (Figure 4.6, on the next page). Neither petroleum nor fat dissolves in water; both are hydrophobic compounds because the great majority of their bonds are relatively nonpolar carbon-to-hydrogen linkages. Another characteristic of hydrocarbons is that they can undergo reactions that release a relatively large amount of energy. The gasoline that fuels a car consists of hydrocarbons, and the hydrocarbon tails of fats serve as stored fuel for animals.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 10.8 Why leaves are green: interaction of light with chloroplasts. The chlorophyll molecules of chloroplasts absorb violet-blue and red light (the colors most effective in driving photosynthesis) and reflect or transmit green light. This is why leaves appear green. When light meets matter, it may be reflected, transmitted, or absorbed. Substances that absorb visible light are known as pigments. Different pigments absorb light of different wavelengths, and the wavelengths that are absorbed disappear. If a pigment is illuminated with white light, the color we see is the color most reflected or transmitted by the pigment. (If a pigment absorbs all wavelengths, it appears black. ) We see green when we look at a leaf because chlorophyll absorbs violet-blue and red light while transmitting and reflecting green light (Figure 10.8).</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>What exactly happens when chlorophyll and other pigments absorb light? The colors corresponding to the absorbed wavelengths disappear from the spectrum of the transmitted and reflected light, but energy cannot disappear. When a molecule absorbs a photon of light, one of the molecule's electrons is elevated to an orbital where it has more potential energy. When the electron is in its normal orbital, the pigment molecule is said to be in its ground state. Absorption of a photon boosts an electron to an orbital of higher energy, and the pigment molecule is then said to be in an excited state. The only photons absorbed are those whose energy is exactly equal to the energy difference between the ground state and an excited state, and this energy difference varies from one kind of molecule to another. Thus, a particular compound absorbs only photons corresponding to specific wavelengths, which is why each pigment has a unique absorption spectrum. Figure 10.12 Excitation of isolated 
chlorophyll by light. (a) Absorption of a photon causes a transition of the chlorophyll molecule from its ground state to its excited state. The photon boosts an electron to an orbital where it has more potential energy. If the illuminated molecule exists in isolation, its excited electron immediately drops back down to the ground-state orbital, and its excess energy is given off as heat and fluorescence (light). (b) A chlorophyll solution excited with ultraviolet light fluoresces with a red-orange glow. Once absorption of a photon raises an electron from the ground state to an excited state, the electron cannot remain there long. The excited state, like all high-energy states, is unstable. Generally, when isolated pigment molecules absorb light, their excited electrons drop back down to the ground-state orbital in a billionth of a second, releasing their excess energy as heat. This conversion of light energy to heat is what makes the top of an automobile so hot on a sunny day. (White cars are coolest 
because their paint reflects all wavelengths of visible light, although it may absorb ultraviolet and other invisible radiation. ) In isolation, some pigments, including chlorophyll, emit light as well as heat after absorbing photons. As excited electrons fall back to the ground state, photons are given off. This afterglow is called fluorescence. If a solution of chlorophyll isolated from chloroplasts is illuminated, it will fluoresce in the red-orange part of the spectrum and also give off heat (Figure 10.12).</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Chlorophyll molecules excited by the absorption of light energy produce very different results in an intact chloroplast than they do in isolation (see Figure 10.12). In their native environment of the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll molecules are organized along with other small organic molecules and proteins into complexes called photosystems. Figure 10.13 The structure and function of a photosystem. A photosystem is composed of a reaction-center complex surrounded by several light-harvesting complexes (Figure 10.13). The reaction-center complex is an organized association of proteins holding a special pair of chlorophyll a molecules. Each light-harvesting complex consists of various pigment molecules (which may include chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids) bound to proteins. The number and variety of pigment molecules enable a photosystem to harvest light over a larger surface area and a larger portion of the spectrum than could any single pigment molecule alone. Together, 
these light-harvesting complexes act as an antenna for the reaction-center complex. When a pigment molecule absorbs a photon, the energy is transferred from pigment molecule to pigment molecule within a light-harvesting complex, somewhat like a human "wave" at a sports arena, until it is passed into the reaction-center complex. The reaction-center complex also contains a molecule capable of accepting electrons and becoming reduced; this is called the primary electron acceptor. The pair of chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction-center complex are special because their molecular environment: their location and the other molecules with which they are associated: enables them to use the energy from light not only to boost one of their electrons to a higher energy level, but also to transfer it to a different molecule: the primary electron acceptor. The solar-powered transfer of an electron from the reaction- center chlorophyll a pair to the primary electron acceptor is the first step of the light reactions. As 
soon as the chlorophyll electron is excited to a higher energy level, the primary electron acceptor captures it; this is a redox reaction. In the flask shown in Figure 10.12, isolated chlorophyll fluoresces because there is no electron acceptor, so electrons of photoexcited chlorophyll drop right back to the ground state. In the structured environment of a chloroplast, however, an electron acceptor is readily available, and the potential energy represented by the excited electron is not dissipated as light and heat. Thus, each photosystem: a reaction-center complex surrounded by light-harvesting complexes: functions in the chloroplast as a unit. It converts light energy to chemical energy, which will ultimately be used for the synthesis of sugar. The thylakoid membrane is populated by two types of photosystems that cooperate in the light reactions of photosynthesis. They are called photosystem II (PS II) and photosystem I (PS I). (They were named in order of their discovery, but photosystem II functions 
first in the light reactions. ) Each has a characteristic reaction-center complex: a particular kind of primary electron acceptor next to a special pair of chlorophyll a molecules associated with specific proteins. The reaction-center chlorophyll a of photosystem II is known as P680 because this pigment is best at absorbing light having a wavelength of 680 nm (in the red part of the spectrum). The chlorophyll a at the reaction-center complex of photosystem I is called P700 because it most effectively absorbs light of wavelength 700 nm (in the far-red part of the spectrum). These two pigments, P680 and P700, are nearly identical chlorophyll a molecules</justification>

        <justification>A photon of light strikes a pigment molecule in a light-harvesting complex of PS II, boosting one of its electrons to a higher energy level. As this electron falls back to its ground state, an electron in a nearby pigment molecule is simultaneously raised to an excited state. The process continues, with the energy being relayed to other pigment molecules until it reaches the P680 pair of chlorophyll a molecules in the PS II reaction-center complex. It excites an electron in this pair of chlorophylls to a higher energy state. This electron is transferred from the excited P680 to the primary electron acceptor. We can refer to the resulting form of P680, missing an electron, as P680+. An enzyme catalyzes the splitting of a water molecule into two electrons, two hydrogen ions (H+), and an oxygen atom. The electrons are supplied one by one to the P680+ pair, each electron replacing one transferred to the primary electron acceptor. (P680+ is the strongest biological oxidizing agent known; 
its electron "hole" must be filled. This greatly facilitates the transfer of electrons from the split water molecule. ) The H+ are released into the thylakoid lumen. The oxygen atom immediately combines with an oxygen atom generated by the splitting of another water molecule, forming O2.</justification>

A pigment goes from a ground state to an excited state when a photon of light boosts one of the pigment's electrons to a higher-energy orbital. This excited state is unstable. Electrons from isolated pigments tend to fall back to the ground state, giving off heat and/or light. A photosystem is composed of a reaction-center complex surrounded by light-harvesting complexes that funnel the energy of photons to the reaction-center complex.

      <answer>
        <justification>Now let's look at the citric acid cycle in more detail. The cycle has eight steps, each catalyzed by a specific enzyme. You can see in Figure 9.12 that for each turn of the citric acid cycle, two carbons (red) enter in the relatively reduced form of an acetyl group (step 1), and two different carbons (blue) leave in the completely oxidized form of CO2 molecules (steps 3 and 4). The acetyl group of acetyl CoA joins the cycle by combining with the compound oxaloacetate, forming citrate (step 1). (Citrate is the ionized form of citric acid, for which the cycle is named. ) The next seven steps decompose the citrate back to oxaloacetate. It is this regeneration of oxaloacetate that makes this process a cycle. Now let's tally the energy-rich molecules produced by the citric acid cycle. For each acetyl group entering the cycle, 3 NAD+ are reduced to NADH (steps 3, 4, and 8). In step 6, electrons are transferred not to NAD+, but to FAD, which accepts 2 electrons and 2 protons to become FADH2. 
In many animal tissue cells, step 5 produces a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) molecule by substrate-level phosphorylation, as shown in Figure 9.12. GTP is a molecule similar to ATP in its structure and cellular function. This GTP may be used to make an ATP molecule (as shown) or directly power work in the cell. In the cells of plants, bacteria, and some animal tissues, step 5 forms an ATP molecule directly by substrate-level phosphorylation. The output from step 5 represents the only ATP generated directly by the citric acid cycle.</justification>

For this to occur, there must be a sufficient supply of NAD+ to accept electrons during the oxidation step of glycolysis. Without some mechanism to recycle NAD+ from NADH, glycolysis would soon deplete the cell's pool of NAD+ by reducing it all to NADH and would shut itself down for lack of an oxidizing agent. Under aerobic conditions, NAD+ is recycled from NADH by the transfer of electrons to the electron transport chain.

        <justification>Fermentation consists of glycolysis plus reactions that regenerate NAD+ by transferring electrons from NADH to pyruvate or derivatives of pyruvate. The NAD+ can then be reused to oxidize sugar by glycolysis, which nets two molecules of ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. There are many types of fermentation, differing in the end products formed from pyruvate. Two common types are alcohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation. Figure 9.17 Fermentation. In the absence of oxygen, many cells use fermentation to produce ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. Pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, serves as an electron acceptor for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which can then be reused in glycolysis. Two of the common end products formed from fermentation are (a) ethanol and (b) lactate, the ionized form of lactic acid. In alcohol fermentation (Figure 9.17a), pyruvate is converted to ethanol (ethyl alcohol) in two steps. The first step releases carbon dioxide from the pyruvate, 
which is converted to the two-carbon compound acetaldehyde. In the second step, acetaldehyde is reduced by NADH to ethanol. This regenerates the supply of NAD+ needed for the continuation of glycolysis. Many bacteria carry out alcohol fermentation under anaerobic conditions. Yeast (a fungus) also carries out alcohol fermentation. For thousands of years, humans have used yeast in brewing, winemaking, and baking. The CO2 bubbles generated by baker's yeast during alcohol fermentation allow bread to rise. During lactic acid fermentation (Figure 9.17b), pyruvate is reduced directly by NADH to form lactate as an end product, with no release of CO2.

Without an electron transport chain, the energy still stored in pyruvate is unavailable to most cells. Thus, cellular respiration harvests much more energy from each sugar molecule than fermentation can. In fact, aerobic respiration yields up to 16 times as much ATP per glucose molecule as does fermentation: up to 32 molecules of ATP for respiration, compared with 2 molecules of ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation in fermentation.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 7.21 Cotransport: active transport driven by a concentration gradient. A carrier protein, such as this sucrose-H+ cotransporter in a plant cell, is able to use the diffusion of H+ down its electrochemical gradient into the cell to drive the uptake of sucrose. The H+ gradient is maintained by an ATP-driven proton pump that concentrates H+ outside the cell, thus storing potential energy that can be used for active transport, in this case of sucrose. Thus, ATP indirectly provides the energy necessary for cotransport. (The cell wall is not shown. ) A single ATP-powered pump that transports a specific solute can indirectly drive the active transport of several other solutes in a mechanism called cotransport. A substance that has been pumped across a membrane can do work as it moves back across the membrane by diffusion, analogous to water that has been pumped uphill and performs work as it flows back down. Another transport protein, a cotransporter separate from the pump, can couple 
the "downhill" diffusion of this substance to the "uphill" transport of a second substance against its own concentration (or electrochemical) gradient. For example, a plant cell uses the gradient of H+ generated by its proton pumps to drive the active transport of amino acids, sugars, and several other nutrients into the cell. One transport protein couples the return of H+ to the transport of sucrose into the cell (Figure 7.21). This protein can translocate sucrose into the cell against a concentration gradient, but only if the sucrose molecule travels in the company of a hydrogen ion. The hydrogen ion uses the transport protein as an avenue to diffuse down the electrochemical gradient maintained by the proton pump. Plants use sucrose-H+ cotransport to load sucrose produced by photosynthesis into cells in the veins of leaves. The vascular tissue of the plant can then distribute the sugar to nonphotosynthetic organs, such as roots. What we know about cotransport proteins in animal cells has helped us find 
more effective treatments for diarrhea, a serious problem in developing countries. Normally, sodium in waste is reabsorbed in the colon, maintaining constant levels in the body, but diarrhea expels waste so rapidly that reabsorption is not possible, and sodium levels fall precipitously. To treat this life-threatening condition, patients are given a solution to drink containing high concentrations of salt (NaCl) and glucose. The solutes are taken up by sodium-glucose cotransporters on the surface of intestinal cells and passed through the cells into the blood.

An H+/sucrose cotransporter couples movement of sucrose against its concentration gradient with movement of H+ down its electrochemical gradient (Figure 36.7b).

        <justification>The electron transport chain makes no ATP directly. Instead, it eases the fall of electrons from food to oxygen, breaking a large free-energy drop into a series of smaller steps that release energy in manageable amounts. How does the mitochondrion (or the prokaryotic plasma membrane) couple this electron transport and energy release to ATP synthesis? The answer is a mechanism called chemiosmosis.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Populating the inner membrane of the mitochondrion or the prokaryotic plasma membrane are many copies of a protein complex called ATP synthase, the enzyme that actually makes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. ATP synthase works like an ion pump running in reverse. Recall from Chapter 7 that ion pumps usually use ATP as an energy source to transport ions against their gradients. In fact, the proton pump shown in Figure 7.20 is an ATP synthase. As we mentioned in Chapter 8, enzymes can catalyze a reaction in either direction, depending on the deltaG for the reaction, which is affected by the local concentrations of reactants and products. Rather than hydrolyzing ATP to pump protons against their concentration gradient, under the conditions of cellular respiration ATP synthase uses the energy of an existing ion gradient to power ATP synthesis. The power source for the ATP synthase is a difference in the concentration of H+ on opposite sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane. (We can 
also think of this gradient as a difference in pH, since pH is a measure of H+ concentration. ) This process, in which energy stored in the form of a hydrogen ion gradient across a membrane is used to drive cellular work such as the synthesis of ATP, is called chemiosmosis (from the Greek osmos, push). We have previously used the word osmosis in discussing water transport, but here it refers to the flow of H+ across a membrane. Figure 9.14 ATP synthase, a molecular mill. The ATP synthase protein complex functions as a mill, powered by the flow of hydrogen ions. Multiple copies of this complex reside in mitochondrial and chloroplast membranes of eukaryotes and in the plasma membranes of prokaryotes. Each of the four parts of ATP synthase consists of a number of polypeptide subunits. From studying the structure of ATP synthase, scientists have learned how the flow of H+ through this large enzyme powers ATP generation. ATP synthase is a multisubunit complex with four main parts, each made up of multiple 
polypeptides. Protons move one by one into binding sites on one of the parts (the rotor), causing it to spin in a way that catalyzes ATP production from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Figure 9.14). The flow of protons thus behaves somewhat like a rushing stream that turns a waterwheel. ATP synthase is the smallest molecular rotary motor known in nature.

        <justification>In general terms, chemiosmosis is an energy-coupling mechanism that uses energy stored in the form of an H+ gradient across a membrane to drive cellular work. In mitochondria, the energy for gradient formation comes from exergonic redox reactions, and ATP synthesis is the work performed. But chemiosmosis also occurs elsewhere and in other variations. Chloroplasts use chemiosmosis to generate ATP during photosynthesis; in these organelles, light (rather than chemical energy) drives both electron flow down an electron transport chain and the resulting H+ gradient formation. Prokaryotes, as already mentioned, generate H+ gradients across their plasma membranes. They then tap the proton-motive force not only to make ATP inside the cell but also to rotate their flagella and to pump nutrients and waste products across the membrane. Because of its central importance to energy conversions in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, chemiosmosis has helped unify the study of bioenergetics. Peter Mitchell 
was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978 for originally proposing the chemiosmotic model.</justification>

        <justification>Chloroplasts and mitochondria generate ATP by the same basic mechanism: chemiosmosis. An electron transport chain assembled in a membrane pumps protons across the membrane as electrons are passed through a series of carriers that are progressively more electronegative. In this way, electron transport chains transform redox energy to a proton-motive force, potential energy stored in the form of an H+ gradient across a membrane. Built into the same membrane is an ATP synthase complex that couples the diffusion of hydrogen ions down their gradient to the phosphorylation of ADP. Some of the electron carriers, including the iron-containing proteins called cytochromes, are very similar in chloroplasts and mitochondria. The ATP synthase complexes of the two organelles are also very much alike. But there are noteworthy differences between oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and photophosphorylation in chloroplasts. In mitochondria, the high-energy electrons dropped down the transport 
chain are extracted from organic molecules (which are thus oxidized), while in chloroplasts, the source of electrons is water. Chloroplasts do not need molecules from food to make ATP; their photosystems capture light energy and use it to drive the electrons from water to the top of the transport chain. In other words, mitochondria use chemiosmosis to transfer chemical energy from food molecules to ATP, whereas chloroplasts transform light energy into chemical energy in ATP. Figure 10.18 The light reactions and chemiosmosis: the organization of the thylakoid membrane. This diagram shows a current model for the organization of the thylakoid membrane. The gold arrows track the linear electron flow outlined in Figure 10.14. As electrons pass from carrier to carrier in redox reactions, hydrogen ions removed from the stroma are deposited in the thylakoid space, storing energy as a proton-motive force (H+ gradient). At least three steps in the light reactions contribute to the proton gradient: &amp;#x278A; Water 
is split by photosystem II on the side of the membrane facing the thylakoid space; &amp;#x278B; as plastoquinone (Pq), a mobile carrier, transfers electrons to the cytochrome complex, four protons are translocated across the membrane into the thylakoid space; and &amp;#x278C; a hydrogen ion is removed from the stroma when it is taken up by NADP+. Notice that in step 2, hydrogen ions are being pumped from the stroma into the thylakoid space, as in Figure 10.17. The diffusion of H+ from the thylakoid space back to the stroma (along the H+ concentration gradient) powers the ATP synthase. These light-driven reactions store chemical energy in NADPH and ATP, which shuttle the energy to the carbohydrate-producing Calvin cycle. Figure 10.17 Comparison of chemiosmosis in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In both kinds of organelles, electron transport chains pump protons (H+) across a membrane from a region of low H+ concentration (light gray in this diagram) to one of high H+ concentration (dark gray). The protons then 
diffuse back across the membrane through ATP synthase, driving the synthesis of ATP. Although the spatial organization of chemiosmosis differs slightly between chloroplasts and mitochondria, it is easy to see similarities in the two (Figure 10.17). The inner membrane of the mitochondrion pumps protons from the mitochondrial matrix out to the intermembrane space, which then serves as a reservoir of hydrogen ions. The thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast pumps protons from the stroma into the thylakoid space (interior of the thylakoid), which functions as the H+ reservoir. If you imagine the cristae of mitochondria pinching off from the inner membrane, this may help you see how the thylakoid space and the intermembrane space are comparable spaces in the two organelles, while the mitochondrial matrix is analogous to the stroma of the chloroplast. In the mitochondrion, protons diffuse down their concentration gradient from the intermembrane space through ATP synthase to the matrix, driving ATP synthesis. In the 
chloroplast, ATP is synthesized as the hydrogen ions diffuse from the thylakoid space back to the stroma through ATP synthase complexes, whose catalytic knobs are on the stroma side of the membrane.</justification>

    <text>How is energy stored in the cell?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>The major function of fats is energy storage. The hydrocarbon chains of fats are similar to gasoline molecules and just as rich in energy. A gram of fat stores more than twice as much energy as a gram of a polysaccharide, such as starch. Because plants are relatively immobile, they can function with bulky energy storage in the form of starch. (Vegetable oils are generally obtained from seeds, where more compact storage is an asset to the plant. ) Animals, however, must carry their energy stores with them, so there is an advantage to having a more compact reservoir of fuel: fat. Humans and other mammals stock their long-term food reserves in adipose cells (see Figure 4.6a), which swell and shrink as fat is deposited and withdrawn from storage. In addition to storing energy, adipose tissue also cushions such vital organs as the kidneys, and a layer of fat beneath the skin insulates the body. This subcutaneous layer is especially thick in whales, seals, and most other marine mammals, 
protecting them from cold ocean water.</justification>

        <justification>Energy released by breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell is used to phosphorylate ADP, regenerating ATP. Chemical potential energy stored in ATP drives most cellular work. An organism at work uses ATP continuously, but ATP is a renewable resource that can be regenerated by the addition of phosphate to ADP (Figure 8.11). The free energy required to phosphorylate ADP comes from exergonic breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell. This shuttling of inorganic phosphate and energy is called the ATP cycle, and it couples the cell's energy-yielding (exergonic) processes to the energy-consuming (endergonic) ones.</justification>

        <justification>As summarized in Figure 9.8, glycolysis can be divided into two phases: energy investment and energy payoff. During the energy investment phase, the cell actually spends ATP. This investment is repaid with interest during the energy payoff phase, when ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation and NAD+ is reduced to NADH by electrons released from the oxidation of glucose. The net energy yield from glycolysis, per glucose molecule, is 2 ATP plus 2 NADH. The ten steps of the glycolytic pathway are shown in Figure 9.9. All of the carbon originally present in glucose is accounted for in the two molecules of pyruvate; no carbon is released as CO2 during glycolysis. Glycolysis occurs whether or not O2 is present. However, if O2 is present, the chemical energy stored in pyruvate and NADH can be extracted by pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.</justification>

        <justification>Establishing the H+ gradient is a major function of the electron transport chain, which is shown in its mitochondrial location in Figure 9.15. The chain is an energy converter that uses the exergonic flow of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to pump H+ across the membrane, from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. The H+ has a tendency to move back across the membrane, diffusing down its gradient. And the ATP synthases are the only sites that provide a route through the membrane for H+. As we described previously, the passage of H+ through ATP synthase uses the exergonic flow of H+ to drive the phosphorylation of ADP. Thus, the energy stored in an H+ gradient across a membrane couples the redox reactions of the electron transport chain to ATP synthesis, an example of chemiosmosis.</justification>

        <justification>Cellular respiration is a more complete breakdown of glucose; in aerobic respiration, oxygen is used as a reactant. The cell taps the energy stored in food molecules through redox reactions, in which one substance partially or totally shifts electrons to another. Oxidation is the loss of electrons from one substance, while reduction is the addition of electrons to the other. During aerobic respiration, glucose (C6H12O6) is oxidized to CO2, and O2 is reduced to H2O. Electrons lose potential energy during their transfer from glucose or other organic compounds to oxygen. Electrons are usually passed first to NAD+, reducing it to NADH, and then from NADH to an electron transport chain, which conducts them to O2 in energy-releasing steps.</justification>

        <justification>In humans, the first sites used for energy storage are liver and muscle cells. In these cells, excess energy from the diet is stored in glycogen, a polymer made up of many glucose units (see Figure 5.6b). Once glycogen depots are full, any additional excess energy is usually stored in fat in adipose cells. When fewer calories are taken in than are expended: perhaps because of sustained heavy exercise or lack of food: the human body generally expends liver glycogen first and then draws on muscle glycogen and fat. Fats are especially rich in energy; oxidizing a gram of fat liberates about twice the energy liberated from a gram of carbohydrate or protein. For this reason, adipose tissue provides the most space-efficient way for the body to store large amounts of energy. Most healthy people have enough stored fat to sustain them through several weeks without food.</justification>

        <justification>The synthesis and breakdown of glycogen is central not only to energy storage, but also to maintaining metabolic balance through glucose homeostasis. Tissues throughout the body rely on the generation of ATP by oxidation of glucose to fuel cellular processes (see Chapter 9). The pancreatic hormones insulin and glucagon maintain glucose homeostasis by tightly regulating the synthesis and breakdown of glycogen. Figure 41.20 Homeostatic regulation of cellular fuel. After a meal is digested, glucose and other monomers are absorbed into the blood from the digestive tract. The human body regulates the use and storage of glucose, a major cellular fuel. The liver is a key site for glucose homeostasis (Figure 41.20). When insulin levels rise after a carbohydrate-rich meal, glucose entering the liver in the hepatic portal vein is used to synthesize glycogen. Between meals, when blood in the hepatic portal vein has a much lower glucose concentration, glucagon stimulates the liver to break down 
glycogen, releasing glucose into the blood.</justification>

        <justification>All of the molecules shown in Figures 4.3 and 4.5 are hydrocarbons, organic molecules consisting of only carbon and hydrogen. Atoms of hydrogen are attached to the carbon skeleton wherever electrons are available for covalent bonding. Hydrocarbons are the major components of petroleum, which is called a fossil fuel because it consists of the partially decomposed remains of organisms that lived millions of years ago. Figure 4.6 The role of hydrocarbons in fats. (a) Mammalian adipose cells stockpile fat molecules as a fuel reserve. This colorized TEM shows part of a human adipose cell with many fat droplets, each containing a large number of fat molecules. (b) A fat molecule consists of a small, nonhydrocarbon component joined to three hydrocarbon tails that account for the hydrophobic behavior of fats. The tails can be broken down to provide energy. (Black = carbon; gray = hydrogen; red = oxygen. ) Although hydrocarbons are not prevalent in most living organisms, many of a cell's 
organic molecules have regions consisting of only carbon and hydrogen. For example, the molecules known as fats have long hydrocarbon tails attached to a nonhydrocarbon component (Figure 4.6, on the next page). Neither petroleum nor fat dissolves in water; both are hydrophobic compounds because the great majority of their bonds are relatively nonpolar carbon-to-hydrogen linkages. Another characteristic of hydrocarbons is that they can undergo reactions that release a relatively large amount of energy. The gasoline that fuels a car consists of hydrocarbons, and the hydrocarbon tails of fats serve as stored fuel for animals.</justification>

    <text>How is co2 concentration kept high in bundle-sheath cells in c4 plants?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>A unique leaf anatomy is correlated with the mechanism of C4 photosynthesis (Figure 10.20; compare with Figure 10.4). In C4 plants, there are two distinct types of photosynthetic cells: bundle-sheath cells and mesophyll cells. Bundle-sheath cells are arranged into tightly packed sheaths around the veins of the leaf. Between the bundle sheath and the leaf surface are the more loosely arranged mesophyll cells. The Calvin cycle is confined to the chloroplasts of the bundle-sheath cells. However, the Calvin cycle is preceded by incorporation of CO2 into organic compounds in the mesophyll cells. See the numbered steps in Figure 10.20, which are also described here: The first step is carried out by an enzyme present only in mesophyll cells called PEP carboxylase. This enzyme adds CO2 to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), forming the four-carbon product oxaloacetate. PEP carboxylase has a much higher affinity for CO2 than does rubisco and no affinity for O2. Therefore, PEP carboxylase can fix carbon 
efficiently when rubisco cannot: that is, when it is hot and dry and stomata are partially closed, causing CO2 concentration in the leaf to fall and O2 concentration to rise. After the C4 plant fixes carbon from CO2, the mesophyll cells export their four-carbon products (malate in the example shown in Figure 10.20) to bundle-sheath cells through plasmodesmata (see Figure 6.31). Within the bundle-sheath cells, the four-carbon compounds release CO2, which is reassimilated into organic material by rubisco and the Calvin cycle. The same reaction regenerates pyruvate, which is transported to mesophyll cells. There, ATP is used to convert pyruvate to PEP, allowing the reaction cycle to continue; this ATP can be thought of as the "price" of concentrating CO2 in the bundle-sheath cells. To generate this extra ATP, bundle-sheath cells carry out cyclic electron flow, the process described earlier in this chapter (see Figure 10.16). In fact, these cells contain PS I but no PS II, so cyclic electron flow is their only 
photosynthetic mode of generating ATP. In effect, the mesophyll cells of a C4 plant pump CO2 into the bundle sheath, keeping the CO2 concentration in the bundle-sheath cells high enough for rubisco to bind carbon dioxide rather than oxygen. The cyclic series of reactions involving PEP carboxylase and the regeneration of PEP can be thought of as a CO2-concentrating pump that is powered by ATP. In this way, C4 photosynthesis minimizes photorespiration and enhances sugar production. This adaptation is especially advantageous in hot regions with intense sunlight, where stomata partially close during the day, and it is in such environments that C4 plants evolved and thrive today.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 8.9 How ATP drives chemical work: Energy coupling using ATP hydrolysis. In this example, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis is used to drive an endergonic process: the cellular synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid and ammonia. For example, with the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to use the energy released by ATP hydrolysis directly to drive chemical reactions that, by themselves, are endergonic. If the deltaG of an endergonic reaction is less than the amount of energy released by ATP hydrolysis, then the two reactions can be coupled so that, overall, the coupled reactions are exergonic (Figure 8.9). This usually involves the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to some other molecule, such as the reactant. The recipient with the phosphate group covalently bonded to it is then called a phosphorylated intermediate. The key to coupling exergonic and endergonic reactions is the formation of this phosphorylated intermediate, which is more 
reactive (less stable) than the original unphosphorylated molecule.</justification>

This can occur either (a) directly, by phosphorylation, as shown for a membrane protein carrying out active transport of a solute (see also Figure 7.18), or (b) indirectly, via noncovalent binding of ATP and its hydrolytic products, as is the case for motor proteins that move vesicles (and other organelles) along cytoskeletal "tracks" in the cell (see also Figure 6.21). Transport and mechanical work in the cell are also nearly always powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. In these cases, ATP hydrolysis leads to a change in a protein's shape and often its ability to bind another molecule. Sometimes this occurs via a phosphorylated intermediate, as seen for the transport protein in Figure 8.10a. In most instances of mechanical work involving motor proteins "walking" along cytoskeletal elements (Figure 8.10b), a cycle occurs in which ATP is first bound 
noncovalently to the motor protein. Next, ATP is hydrolyzed, releasing ADP and &amp;#9413;i. Another ATP molecule can then bind. At each stage, the motor protein changes its shape and ability to bind the cytoskeleton, resulting in movement of the protein along the cytoskeletal track.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Populating the inner membrane of the mitochondrion or the prokaryotic plasma membrane are many copies of a protein complex called ATP synthase, the enzyme that actually makes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. ATP synthase works like an ion pump running in reverse. Recall from Chapter 7 that ion pumps usually use ATP as an energy source to transport ions against their gradients. In fact, the proton pump shown in Figure 7.20 is an ATP synthase. As we mentioned in Chapter 8, enzymes can catalyze a reaction in either direction, depending on the deltaG for the reaction, which is affected by the local concentrations of reactants and products. Rather than hydrolyzing ATP to pump protons against their concentration gradient, under the conditions of cellular respiration ATP synthase uses the energy of an existing ion gradient to power ATP synthesis. The power source for the ATP synthase is a difference in the concentration of H+ on opposite sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane. (We can 
also think of this gradient as a difference in pH, since pH is a measure of H+ concentration. ) This process, in which energy stored in the form of a hydrogen ion gradient across a membrane is used to drive cellular work such as the synthesis of ATP, is called chemiosmosis (from the Greek osmos, push). We have previously used the word osmosis in discussing water transport, but here it refers to the flow of H+ across a membrane. Figure 9.14 ATP synthase, a molecular mill. The ATP synthase protein complex functions as a mill, powered by the flow of hydrogen ions. Multiple copies of this complex reside in mitochondrial and chloroplast membranes of eukaryotes and in the plasma membranes of prokaryotes. Each of the four parts of ATP synthase consists of a number of polypeptide subunits. From studying the structure of ATP synthase, scientists have learned how the flow of H+ through this large enzyme powers ATP generation. ATP synthase is a multisubunit complex with four main parts, each made up of multiple 
polypeptides. Protons move one by one into binding sites on one of the parts (the rotor), causing it to spin in a way that catalyzes ATP production from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Figure 9.14). The flow of protons thus behaves somewhat like a rushing stream that turns a waterwheel. ATP synthase is the smallest molecular rotary motor known in nature.</justification>

    <text>How do channels open or close?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>As described earlier, the two types of transport proteins are channel proteins and carrier proteins. Channel proteins simply provide corridors that allow specific molecules or ions to cross the membrane (Figure 7.17a). The hydrophilic passageways provided by these proteins can allow water molecules or small ions to diffuse very quickly from one side of the membrane to the other. Aquaporins, the water channel proteins, facilitate the massive amounts of diffusion that occur in plant cells and in animal cells such as red blood cells (see Figure 7.15). Certain kidney cells also have a high number of aquaporins, allowing them to reclaim water from urine before it is excreted. If the kidneys did not perform this function, you would excrete about 180 L of urine per day: and have to drink an equal volume of water! Channel proteins that transport ions are called ion channels. Many ion channels function as gated channels, which open or close in response to a stimulus. For some gated channels, 
the stimulus is electrical. The ion channel shown in Figure 7.1, for example, opens in response to an electrical stimulus, allowing potassium ions to leave the cell. Other gated channels open or close when a specific substance other than the one to be transported binds to the channel. Both types of gated channels are important in the functioning of the nervous system, as you'll learn in Chapter 48.</justification>

If a depolarization opens voltage-gated sodium channels, the resulting flow of Na+ into the neuron results in further depolarization. Because the sodium channels are voltage gated, an increased depolarization causes more sodium channels to open, leading to an even greater flow of current.

        <justification>At many chemical synapses, the receptor protein that binds and responds to neurotransmitters is a ligand-gated ion channel, often called an ionotropic receptor. These receptors are clustered in the membrane of the postsynaptic cell, directly opposite the synaptic terminal. Binding of the neurotransmitter (the receptor's ligand) to a particular part of the receptor opens the channel and allows specific ions to diffuse across the postsynaptic membrane. The result is a postsynaptic potential, a graded potential in the postsynaptic cell. At some synapses, the ligand-gated ion channel is permeable to both K+ and Na+ (see Figure 48.15). When this channel opens, the membrane potential depolarizes toward a value roughly midway between EK and ENa. Because such a depolarization brings the membrane potential toward threshold, it is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP).</justification>

        <justification>So far, we have focused on synapses where a neurotransmitter binds directly to an ion channel, causing the channel to open. However, there are also synapses in which the receptor for the neurotransmitter is not part of an ion channel. At these synapses, the neurotransmitter binds to a metabotropic receptor, so called because the resulting opening or closing of ion channels depends on one or more metabolic steps. Binding of a neurotransmitter to a metabotropic receptor activates a signal transduction pathway in the postsynaptic cell involving a second messenger (see Chapter 11). Compared with the postsynaptic potentials produced by ligand-gated channels, the effects of these second-messenger systems have a slower onset but last longer (minutes or even hours). Second messengers modulate the responsiveness of postsynaptic neurons to inputs in diverse ways, such as by altering the number of open potassium channels.</justification>

        <justification>48.3 Action potentials are the signals conducted by axons (pp. 1050-1055) Neurons have gated ion channels that open or close in response to stimuli, leading to changes in the membrane potential. An increase in the magnitude of the membrane potential is a hyperpolarization; a decrease is a depolarization. Changes in membrane potential that vary continuously with the strength of a stimulus are known as graded potentials. An action potential is a brief, all-or-none depolarization of a neuron's plasma membrane. When a graded depolarization brings the membrane potential to the threshold, many voltage-gated ion channels open, triggering an inflow of Na+ that rapidly brings the membrane potential to a positive value. A negative membrane potential is restored by the inactivation of sodium channels and by the opening of many voltage-gated potassium channels, which increases K+ outflow. A refractory period follows, corresponding to the interval when the sodium channels are inactivated.</justification>

        <justification>As we described in Chapter 6, the cell secretes certain biological molecules by the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane; this process is called exocytosis. A transport vesicle that has budded from the Golgi apparatus moves along microtubules of the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. When the vesicle membrane and plasma membrane come into contact, specific proteins rearrange the lipid molecules of the two bilayers so that the two membranes fuse. The contents of the vesicle then spill to the outside of the cell, and the vesicle membrane becomes part of the plasma membrane (see Figure 7.12, step 4). Many secretory cells use exocytosis to export products. For example, the cells in the pancreas that make insulin secrete it into the extracellular fluid by exocytosis. In another example, neurons (nerve cells) use exocytosis to release neurotransmitters that signal other neurons or muscle cells.

In both kinds of organelles, electron transport chains pump protons (H+) across a membrane from a region of low H+ concentration (light gray in this diagram) to one of high H+ concentration (dark gray). The protons then diffuse back across the membrane through ATP synthase, driving the synthesis of ATP. Although the spatial organization of chemiosmosis differs slightly between chloroplasts and mitochondria, it is easy to see similarities in the two (Figure 10.17). The inner membrane of the mitochondrion pumps protons from the mitochondrial matrix out to the intermembrane space, which then serves as a reservoir of hydrogen ions. The thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast pumps protons from the stroma into the thylakoid space (interior of the thylakoid), which functions as the H+ reservoir. If you imagine the cristae of mitochondria pinching off from the inner membrane, this may help you see how the thylakoid space 
and the intermembrane space are comparable spaces in the two organelles, while the mitochondrial matrix is analogous to the stroma of the chloroplast.

        <justification>Cellular respiration does not oxidize glucose in a single explosive step either. Rather, glucose and other organic fuels are broken down in a series of steps, each one catalyzed by an enzyme. At key steps, electrons are stripped from the glucose. As is often the case in oxidation reactions, each electron travels with a proton: thus, as a hydrogen atom. The hydrogen atoms are not transferred directly to oxygen, but instead are usually passed first to an electron carrier, a coenzyme called NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, a derivative of the vitamin niacin). NAD+ is well suited as an electron carrier because it can cycle easily between oxidized (NAD+) and reduced (NADH) states. As an electron acceptor, NAD+ functions as an oxidizing agent during respiration. Figure 9.4 NAD+ as an electron shuttle. The full name for NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, describes its structure: The molecule consists of two nucleotides joined together at their phosphate groups (shown in yellow). 
(Nicotinamide is a nitrogenous base, although not one that is present in DNA or RNA; see Figure 5.26. ) The enzymatic transfer of 2 electrons and 1 proton (H+) from an organic molecule in food to NAD+ reduces the NAD+ to NADH; the second proton (H+) is released. Most of the electrons removed from food are transferred initially to NAD+. How does NAD+ trap electrons from glucose and other organic molecules? Enzymes called dehydrogenases remove a pair of hydrogen atoms (2 electrons and 2 protons) from the substrate (glucose, in this example), thereby oxidizing it. The enzyme delivers the 2 electrons along with 1 proton to its coenzyme, NAD+ (Figure 9.4). The other proton is released as a hydrogen ion (H+) into the surrounding solution: By receiving 2 negatively charged electrons but only 1 positively charged proton, NAD+ has its charge neutralized when it is reduced to NADH. The name NADH shows the hydrogen that has been received in the reaction. NAD+ is the most versatile electron acceptor in cellular 
respiration and functions in several of the redox steps during the breakdown of glucose. Electrons lose very little of their potential energy when they are transferred from glucose to NAD+. Each NADH molecule formed during respiration represents stored energy that can be tapped to make ATP when the electrons complete their "fall" down an energy gradient from NADH to oxygen.</justification>

This investment is repaid with interest during the energy payoff phase, when ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation and NAD+ is reduced to NADH by electrons released from the oxidation of glucose. The net energy yield from glycolysis, per glucose molecule, is 2 ATP plus 2 NADH. The ten steps of the glycolytic pathway are shown in Figure 9.9. All of the carbon originally present in glucose is accounted for in the two molecules of pyruvate; no carbon is released as CO2 during glycolysis. Glycolysis occurs whether or not O2 is present. However, if O2 is present, the chemical energy stored in pyruvate and NADH can be extracted by pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.</justification>

        <justification>The citric acid cycle is also called the tricarboxylic acid cycle or the Krebs cycle, the latter honoring Hans Krebs, the German-British scientist who was largely responsible for working out the pathway in the 1930s. The cycle functions as a metabolic furnace that oxidizes organic fuel derived from pyruvate. Figure 9.11 summarizes the inputs and outputs as pyruvate is broken down to three CO2 molecules, including the molecule of CO2 released during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. The cycle generates 1 ATP per turn by substrate-level phosphorylation, but most of the chemical energy is transferred to NAD+ and a related electron carrier, the coenzyme FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide, derived from riboflavin, a B vitamin), during the redox reactions. The reduced coenzymes, NADH and FADH2, shuttle their cargo of high-energy electrons into the electron transport chain.</justification>

        <justification>We can picture a cell's metabolism as an elaborate road map of the thousands of chemical reactions that occur in a cell, arranged as intersecting metabolic pathways. A metabolic pathway begins with a specific molecule, which is then altered in a series of defined steps, resulting in a certain product. Each step of the pathway is catalyzed by a specific enzyme: Analogous to the red, yellow, and green stoplights that control the flow of automobile traffic, mechanisms that regulate enzymes balance metabolic supply and demand. Metabolism as a whole manages the material and energy resources of the cell. Some metabolic pathways release energy by breaking down complex molecules to simpler compounds. These degradative processes are called catabolic pathways, or breakdown pathways. A major pathway of catabolism is cellular respiration, in which the sugar glucose and other organic fuels are broken down in the presence of oxygen to carbon dioxide and water. (Pathways can have more than one 
starting molecule and/or product. ) Energy that was stored in the organic molecules becomes available to do the work of the cell, such as ciliary beating or membrane transport. Anabolic pathways, in contrast, consume energy to build complicated molecules from simpler ones; they are sometimes called biosynthetic pathways. Examples of anabolism are the synthesis of an amino acid from simpler molecules and the synthesis of a protein from amino acids. Catabolic and anabolic pathways are the "downhill" and "uphill" avenues of the metabolic landscape. Energy released from the downhill reactions of catabolic pathways can be stored and then used to drive the uphill reactions of anabolic pathways. In this chapter, we will focus on mechanisms common to metabolic pathways. Because energy is fundamental to all metabolic processes, a basic knowledge of energy is necessary to understand how the living cell works. Although we will use some nonliving examples to study energy, the concepts demonstrated by these examples also 
apply to bioenergetics, the study of how energy flows through living organisms.</justification>

        <justification>Once we know the value of deltaG for a process, we can use it to predict whether the process will be spontaneous (that is, whether it is energetically favorable and will occur without an input of energy). More than a century of experiments has shown that only processes with a negative deltaG are spontaneous. For deltaG to be negative, either deltaH must be negative (the system gives up enthalpy and H decreases) or TdeltaS must be positive (the system gives up order and S increases), or both: When deltaH and TdeltaS are tallied, deltaG has a negative value (deltaG &amp;lt; 0) for all spontaneous processes. In other words, every spontaneous process decreases the system's free energy, and processes that have a positive or zero deltaG are never spontaneous. This information is immensely interesting to biologists, for it gives us the power to predict which kinds of change can happen without help. Such spontaneous changes can be harnessed to perform work. This principle is very important in 
the study of metabolism, where a major goal is to determine which reactions can supply energy for cellular work.</justification>

        <justification>Reactions in an isolated system eventually reach equilibrium and can then do no work, as illustrated by the isolated hydroelectric system in Figure 8.7a. The chemical reactions of metabolism are reversible, and they, too, would reach equilibrium if they occurred in the isolation of a test tube. Because systems at equilibrium are at a minimum of G and can do no work, a cell that has reached metabolic equilibrium is dead! The fact that metabolism as a whole is never at equilibrium is one of the defining features of life. Like most systems, a living cell is not in equilibrium. The constant flow of materials in and out of the cell keeps the metabolic pathways from ever reaching equilibrium, and the cell continues to do work throughout its life. This principle is illustrated by the open (and more realistic) hydroelectric system in Figure 8.7b. However, unlike this simple single-step system, a catabolic pathway in a cell releases free energy in a series of reactions. An example is cellular 
respiration, illustrated by analogy in Figure 8.7c. Some of the reversible reactions of respiration are constantly "pulled" in one direction: that is, they are kept out of equilibrium. The key to maintaining this lack of equilibrium is that the product of a reaction does not accumulate but instead becomes a reactant in the next step; finally, waste products are expelled from the cell. The overall sequence of reactions is kept going by the huge free-energy difference between glucose and oxygen at the top of the energy "hill" and carbon dioxide and water at the "downhill" end. As long as our cells have a steady supply of glucose or other fuels and oxygen and are able to expel waste products to the surroundings, their metabolic pathways never reach equilibrium and can continue to do the work of life.</justification>

    <text>How do electrons gain potential energy?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 2.8 Energy levels of an atom's electrons. Electrons exist only at fixed levels of potential energy called electron shells. The electrons of an atom have potential energy because of how they are arranged in relation to the nucleus. The negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positively charged nucleus. It takes work to move a given electron farther away from the nucleus, so the more distant an electron is from the nucleus, the greater its potential energy. Unlike the continuous flow of water downhill, changes in the potential energy of electrons can occur only in steps of fixed amounts. An electron having a certain amount of energy is something like a ball on a staircase (Figure 2.8a). The ball can have different amounts of potential energy, depending on which step it is on, but it cannot spend much time between the steps. Similarly, an electron's potential energy is determined by its energy level. An electron cannot exist between energy levels. An electron's energy 
level is correlated with its average distance from the nucleus. Electrons are found in different electron shells, each with a characteristic average distance and energy level. In diagrams, shells can be represented by concentric circles (Figure 2.8b). The first shell is closest to the nucleus, and electrons in this shell have the lowest potential energy. Electrons in the second shell have more energy, and electrons in the third shell even more energy. An electron can change the shell it occupies, but only by absorbing or losing an amount of energy equal to the difference in potential energy between its position in the old shell and that in the new shell. When an electron absorbs energy, it moves to a shell farther out from the nucleus. For example, light energy can excite an electron to a higher energy level. (Indeed, this is the first step taken when plants harness the energy of sunlight for photosynthesis, the process that produces food from carbon dioxide and water. ) When an electron loses energy, it "
falls back" to a shell closer to the nucleus, and the lost energy is usually released to the environment as heat. For example, sunlight excites electrons in the surface of a car to higher energy levels. When the electrons fall back to their original levels, the car's surface heats up. This thermal energy can be transferred to the air or to your hand if you touch the car.</justification>

    <text>How do electrons interact with the bonds of an organic molecule?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>A covalent bond is the sharing of a pair of valence electrons by two atoms. For example, let's consider what happens when two hydrogen atoms approach each other. Recall that hydrogen has 1 valence electron in the first shell, but the shell's capacity is 2 electrons. When the two hydrogen atoms come close enough for their 1s orbitals to overlap, they can share their electrons (Figure 2.11). Each hydrogen atom is now associated with 2 electrons in what amounts to a completed valence shell. Two or more atoms held together by covalent bonds constitute a molecule, in this case a hydrogen molecule. Figure 2.12 Covalent bonding in four molecules. The number of electrons required to complete an atom's valence shell generally determines how many covalent bonds that atom will form. This figure shows several ways of indicating covalent bonds. Figure 2.12a shows several ways of representing a hydrogen molecule. Its molecular formula, H2, simply indicates that the molecule consists of two atoms of 
hydrogen. Electron sharing can be depicted by an electron distribution diagram or by a Lewis dot structure, in which element symbols are surrounded by dots that represent the valence electrons (H:H). We can also use a structural formula, H-H, where the line represents a single bond, a pair of shared electrons. A space-filling model comes closest to representing the actual shape of the molecule. Oxygen has 6 electrons in its second electron shell and therefore needs 2 more electrons to complete its valence shell. Two oxygen atoms form a molecule by sharing two pairs of valence electrons (Figure 2.12b). The atoms are thus joined by a double bond (O"O). Each atom that can share valence electrons has a bonding capacity corresponding to the number of covalent bonds the atom can form. When the bonds form, they give the atom a full complement of electrons in the valence shell. The bonding capacity of oxygen, for example, is 2. This bonding capacity is called the atom's valence and usually equals the number of 
unpaired electrons required to complete the atom's outermost (valence) shell. See if you can determine the valences of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon by studying the electron distribution diagrams in Figure 2.9. You can see that the valence of hydrogen is 1; oxygen, 2; nitrogen, 3; and carbon, 4. However, the situation is more complicated for elements in the third row of the periodic table. Phosphorus, for example, can have a valence of 3, as we would predict from the presence of 3 unpaired electrons in its valence shell. In some molecules that are biologically important, however, phosphorus can form three single bonds and one double bond. Therefore, it can also have a valence of 5. The molecules H2 and O2 are pure elements rather than compounds because a compound is a combination of two or more different elements. Water, with the molecular formula H2O, is a compound. Two atoms of hydrogen are needed to satisfy the valence of one oxygen atom. Figure 2.12c shows the structure of a water molecule. 
Water is so important to life that Chapter 3 is devoted entirely to its structure and behavior. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a compound with the molecular formula CH4. It takes four hydrogen atoms, each with a valence of 1, to complement one atom of carbon, with its valence of 4 (Figure 2.12d). We will look at many other compounds of carbon in Chapter 4. Figure 2.13 Polar covalent bonds in a water molecule. Atoms in a molecule attract shared electrons to varying degrees, depending on the element. The attraction of a particular atom for the electrons of a covalent bond is called its electronegativity. The more electronegative an atom is, the more strongly it pulls shared electrons toward itself. In a covalent bond between two atoms of the same element, the electrons are shared equally because the two atoms have the same electronegativity: the tug-of-war is at a standoff. Such a bond is called a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, the single bond of H2 is nonpolar, as is the double bond of 
O2. However, when one atom is bonded to a more electronegative atom, the electrons of the bond are not shared equally. This type of bond is called a polar covalent bond. Such bonds vary in their polarity, depending on the relative electronegativity of the two atoms. For example, the bonds between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms of a water molecule are quite polar (Figure 2.13). Oxygen is one of the most electronegative of all the elements, attracting shared electrons much more strongly than hydrogen does. In a covalent bond between oxygen and hydrogen, the electrons spend more time near the oxygen nucleus than they do near the hydrogen nucleus. Because electrons have a negative charge and are pulled toward oxygen in a water molecule, the oxygen atom has a partial negative charge (indicated by the Greek letter delta with a minus sign, delta-, or "delta minus"), and each hydrogen atom has a partial positive charge (, or "delta plus"). In contrast, the individual bonds of methane (CH4) are much less polar because 
the electronegativities of carbon and hydrogen are similar.</justification>

        <justification>Carbon has 6 electrons, with 2 in the first electron shell and 4 in the second shell; thus, it has 4 valence electrons in a shell that holds 8 electrons. A carbon atom usually completes its valence shell by sharing its 4 electrons with other atoms so that 8 electrons are present. Each pair of shared electrons constitutes a covalent bond (see Figure 2.12d). In organic molecules, carbon usually forms single or double covalent bonds. Each carbon atom acts as an intersection point from which a molecule can branch off in as many as four directions. This ability is one facet of carbon's versatility that makes large, complex molecules possible. Figure 4.3 The shapes of three simple organic molecules. When a carbon atom forms four single covalent bonds, the arrangement of its four hybrid orbitals causes the bonds to angle toward the corners of an imaginary tetrahedron (see Figure 2.17b). The bond angles in methane (CH4) are 109.5 degree (Figure 4.3a, and they are roughly the same in any group 
of atoms where carbon has four single bonds. For example, ethane (C2H6) is shaped like two overlapping tetrahedrons (Figure 4.3b). In molecules with more carbons, every grouping of a carbon bonded to four other atoms has a tetrahedral shape. But when two carbon atoms are joined by a double bond, as in ethene (C2H4), the atoms joined to those carbons are in the same plane as the carbons (Figure 4.3c). We find it convenient to write molecules as structural formulas, as if the molecules being represented are two-dimensional, but keep in mind that molecules are three-dimensional and that the shape of a molecule often determines its function. Figure 4.4 Valences of the major elements of organic molecules. Valence is the number of covalent bonds an atom can form. It is generally equal to the number of electrons required to complete the valence (outermost) shell (see Figure 2.9). All the electrons are shown for each atom in the electron distribution diagrams (top). Only the valence shell electrons are shown in the 
Lewis dot structures (bottom). Note that carbon can form four bonds. The electron configuration of carbon gives it covalent compatibility with many different elements. Figure 4.4 shows the valences of carbon and its most frequent partners: hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. These are the four major atomic components of organic molecules. These valences are the basis for the rules of covalent bonding in organic chemistry: the building code for the architecture of organic molecules.</justification>

Somewhat like a tile mosaic, a membrane is a collage of different proteins, often clustered together in groups, embedded in the fluid matrix of the lipid bilayer (see Figure 7.5). More than 50 kinds of proteins have been found so far in the plasma membrane of red blood cells, for example. Phospholipids form the main fabric of the membrane, but proteins determine most of the membrane's functions. Different types of cells contain different sets of membrane proteins, and the various membranes within a cell each have a unique collection of proteins. Figure 7.9 The structure of a transmembrane protein. Bacteriorhodopsin (a bacterial transport protein) has a distinct orientation in the membrane, with its N-terminus outside the cell and its C-terminus inside. This ribbon model highlights the ?-helical secondary structure of the hydrophobic parts, which lie mostly within the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. The protein includes 
seven transmembrane helices. The nonhelical hydrophilic segments are in contact with the aqueous solutions on the extracellular and cytoplasmic sides of the membrane. Notice in Figure 7.5 that there are two major populations of membrane proteins: integral proteins and peripheral proteins. Integral proteins penetrate the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer. The majority are transmembrane proteins, which span the membrane; other integral proteins extend only partway into the hydrophobic interior. The hydrophobic regions of an integral protein consist of one or more stretches of nonpolar amino acids (see Figure 5.16), usually coiled into ? helices (Figure 7.9). The hydrophilic parts of the molecule are exposed to the aqueous solutions on either side of the membrane.

        <justification>Cell membranes are permeable to specific ions and a variety of polar molecules. These hydrophilic substances can avoid contact with the lipid bilayer by passing through transport proteins that span the membrane. Some transport proteins, called channel proteins, function by having a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or atomic ions use as a tunnel through the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, left). For example, the passage of water molecules through the membrane in certain cells is greatly facilitated by channel proteins known as aquaporins. Each aquaporin allows entry of up to 3 billion (3 * 109) water molecules per second, passing single file through its central channel, which fits ten at a time. Without aquaporins, only a tiny fraction of these water molecules would pass through the same area of the cell membrane in a second, so the channel protein brings about a tremendous increase in rate.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 9.6 An overview of cellular respiration. During glycolysis, each glucose molecule is broken down into two molecules of the compound pyruvate. In eukaryotic cells, as shown here, the pyruvate enters the mitochondrion. There it is oxidized to acetyl CoA, which is further oxidized to CO2 in the citric acid cycle. NADH and a similar electron carrier, a coenzyme called FADH2, transfer electrons derived from glucose to electron transport chains, which are built into the inner mitochondrial membrane. (In prokaryotes, the electron transport chains are located in the plasma membrane. ) During oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport chains convert the chemical energy to a form used for ATP synthesis in the process called chemiosmosis. As diagrammed in Figure 9.6, glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation followed by the citric acid cycle are the catabolic pathways that break down glucose and other organic fuels. Glycolysis, which occurs in the cytosol, begins the degradation process by 
breaking glucose into two molecules of a compound called pyruvate. In eukaryotes, pyruvate enters the mitochondrion and is oxidized to a compound called acetyl CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle. There, the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide is completed.

Pyruvate is a charged molecule, so in eukaryotic cells it must enter the mitochondrion via active transport, with the help of a transport protein. Next, a complex of several enzymes (the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) catalyzes the three numbered steps, which are described in the text. The acetyl group of acetyl CoA will enter the citric acid cycle. The CO2 molecule will diffuse out of the cell. By convention, coenzyme A is abbreviated S-CoA when it is attached to a molecule, emphasizing the sulfur atom (S). Upon entering the mitochondrion via active transport, pyruvate is first converted to a compound called acetyl coenzyme A, or acetyl CoA (Figure 9.10). This step, linking glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, is carried out by a multienzyme complex that catalyzes three reactions: &amp;#x278A; Pyruvate's carboxyl group (: COO-'), which is already fully oxidized and thus has little chemical energy,

        <justification>Fermentation consists of glycolysis plus reactions that regenerate NAD+ by transferring electrons from NADH to pyruvate or derivatives of pyruvate. The NAD+ can then be reused to oxidize sugar by glycolysis, which nets two molecules of ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. There are many types of fermentation, differing in the end products formed from pyruvate. Two common types are alcohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation. Figure 9.17 Fermentation. In the absence of oxygen, many cells use fermentation to produce ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. Pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, serves as an electron acceptor for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which can then be reused in glycolysis. Two of the common end products formed from fermentation are (a) ethanol and (b) lactate, the ionized form of lactic acid. In alcohol fermentation (Figure 9.17a), pyruvate is converted to ethanol (ethyl alcohol) in two steps. The first step releases carbon dioxide from the pyruvate, 
which is converted to the two-carbon compound acetaldehyde. In the second step, acetaldehyde is reduced by NADH to ethanol. This regenerates the supply of NAD+ needed for the continuation of glycolysis. Many bacteria carry out alcohol fermentation under anaerobic conditions. Yeast (a fungus) also carries out alcohol fermentation. For thousands of years, humans have used yeast in brewing, winemaking, and baking. The CO2 bubbles generated by baker's yeast during alcohol fermentation allow bread to rise. During lactic acid fermentation (Figure 9.17b), pyruvate is reduced directly by NADH to form lactate as an end product, with no release of CO2.

        <justification>Figure 9.18 Pyruvate as a key juncture in catabolism. Glycolysis is common to fermentation and cellular respiration. The end product of glycolysis, pyruvate, represents a fork in the catabolic pathways of glucose oxidation. In a facultative anaerobe or a muscle cell, which are capable of both aerobic cellular respiration and fermentation, pyruvate is committed to one of those two pathways, usually depending on whether or not oxygen is present. Some organisms, called obligate anaerobes, carry out only fermentation or anaerobic respiration. In fact, these organisms cannot survive in the presence of oxygen, some forms of which can actually be toxic if protective systems are not present in the cell. A few cell types, such as cells of the vertebrate brain, can carry out only aerobic oxidation of pyruvate, not fermentation. Other organisms, including yeasts and many bacteria, can make enough ATP to survive using either fermentation or respiration. Such species are called facultative 
anaerobes. On the cellular level, our muscle cells behave as facultative anaerobes. In such cells, pyruvate is a fork in the metabolic road that leads to two alternative catabolic routes (Figure 9.18). Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate can be converted to acetyl CoA, and oxidation continues in the citric acid cycle via aerobic respiration. Under anaerobic conditions, lactic acid fermentation occurs: Pyruvate is diverted from the citric acid cycle, serving instead as an electron acceptor to recycle NAD+. To make the same amount of ATP, a facultative anaerobe has to consume sugar at a much faster rate when fermenting than when respiring.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 2.14 Electron transfer and ionic bonding. The attraction between oppositely charged atoms, or ions, is an ionic bond. An ionic bond can form between any two oppositely charged ions, even if they have not been formed by transfer of an electron from one to the other. In some cases, two atoms are so unequal in their attraction for valence electrons that the more electronegative atom strips an electron completely away from its partner. This is what happens when an atom of sodium (11Na) encounters an atom of chlorine (17Cl) (Figure 2.14). A sodium atom has a total of 11 electrons, with its single valence electron in the third electron shell. A chlorine atom has a total of 17 electrons, with 7 electrons in its valence shell. When these two atoms meet, the lone valence electron of sodium is transferred to the chlorine atom, and both atoms end up with their valence shells complete. (Because sodium no longer has an electron in the third shell, the second shell is now the valence shell. ) 
The electron transfer between the two atoms moves one unit of negative charge from sodium to chlorine. Sodium, now with 11 protons but only 10 electrons, has a net electrical charge of 1+. A charged atom (or molecule) is called an ion. When the charge is positive, the ion is specifically called a cation; the sodium atom has become a cation. Conversely, the chlorine atom, having gained an extra electron, now has 17 protons and 18 electrons, giving it a net electrical charge of 1-. It has become a chloride ion: an anion, or negatively charged ion. Because of their opposite charges, cations and anions attract each other; this attraction is called an ionic bond.</justification>

    <text>How does facilitated diffusion work?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Let's look more closely at how water and certain hydrophilic solutes cross a membrane. As mentioned earlier, many polar molecules and ions impeded by the lipid bilayer of the membrane diffuse passively with the help of transport proteins that span the membrane. This phenomenon is called facilitated diffusion. Cell biologists are still trying to learn exactly how various transport proteins facilitate diffusion. Most transport proteins are very specific: They transport some substances but not others. Figure 7.17 Two types of transport proteins that carry out facilitated diffusion. In both cases, the protein can transport the solute in either direction, but the net movement is down the concentration gradient of the solute. As described earlier, the two types of transport proteins are channel proteins and carrier proteins. Channel proteins simply provide corridors that allow specific molecules or ions to cross the membrane (Figure 7.17a). The hydrophilic passageways provided by these 
proteins can allow water molecules or small ions to diffuse very quickly from one side of the membrane to the other. Aquaporins, the water channel proteins, facilitate the massive amounts of diffusion that occur in plant cells and in animal cells such as red blood cells (see Figure 7.15). Certain kidney cells also have a high number of aquaporins, allowing them to reclaim water from urine before it is excreted. If the kidneys did not perform this function, you would excrete about 180 L of urine per day: and have to drink an equal volume of water! Channel proteins that transport ions are called ion channels. Many ion channels function as gated channels, which open or close in response to a stimulus. For some gated channels, the stimulus is electrical. The ion channel shown in Figure 7.1, for example, opens in response to an electrical stimulus, allowing potassium ions to leave the cell. Other gated channels open or close when a specific substance other than the one to be transported binds to the channel. Both 
types of gated channels are important in the functioning of the nervous system, as you'll learn in Chapter 48. Carrier proteins, such as the glucose transporter mentioned earlier, seem to undergo a subtle change in shape that somehow translocates the solute-binding site across the membrane (Figure 7.17b). Such a change in shape may be triggered by the binding and release of the transported molecule. Like ion channels, carrier proteins involved in facilitated diffusion result in the net movement of a substance down its concentration gradient. No energy input is thus required: This is passive transport.</justification>

        <justification>Comparing Fermentation with Anaerobic and Aerobic Respiration The Evolutionary Significance of Glycolysis Because most of the ATP generated by cellular respiration is due to the work of oxidative phosphorylation, our estimate of ATP yield from aerobic respiration is contingent on an adequate supply of oxygen to the cell. Without the electronegative oxygen to pull electrons down the transport chain, oxidative phosphorylation eventually ceases. However, there are two general mechanisms by which certain cells can oxidize organic fuel and generate ATP without the use of oxygen: anaerobic respiration and fermentation. The distinction between these two is that an electron transport chain is used in anaerobic respiration but not in fermentation. (The electron transport chain is also called the respiratory chain because of its role in both types of cellular respiration. ) We have already mentioned anaerobic respiration, which takes place in certain prokaryotic organisms that live in 
environments without oxygen. These organisms have an electron transport chain but do not use oxygen as a final electron acceptor at the end of the chain. Oxygen performs this function very well because it is extremely electronegative, but other, less electronegative substances can also serve as final electron acceptors. Some "sulfate-reducing" marine bacteria, for instance, use the sulfate ion (SO42-') at the end of their respiratory chain. Operation of the chain builds up a proton-motive force used to produce ATP, but H2S (hydrogen sulfide) is produced as a by-product rather than water. The rotten-egg odor you may have smelled while walking through a salt marsh or a mudflat signals the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Fermentation is a way of harvesting chemical energy without using either oxygen or any electron transport chain: in other words, without cellular respiration. How can food be oxidized without cellular respiration? Remember, oxidation simply refers to the loss of electrons to an electron 
acceptor, so it does not need to involve oxygen. Glycolysis oxidizes glucose to two molecules of pyruvate. The oxidizing agent of glycolysis is NAD+, and neither oxygen nor any electron transfer chain is involved. Overall, glycolysis is exergonic, and some of the energy made available is used to produce 2 ATP (net) by substrate-level phosphorylation. If oxygen is present, then additional ATP is made by oxidative phosphorylation when NADH passes electrons removed from glucose to the electron transport chain. But glycolysis generates 2 ATP whether oxygen is present or not: that is, whether conditions are aerobic or anaerobic. As an alternative to respiratory oxidation of organic nutrients, fermentation is an extension of glycolysis that allows continuous generation of ATP by the substrate-level phosphorylation of glycolysis. For this to occur, there must be a sufficient supply of NAD+ to accept electrons during the oxidation step of glycolysis. Without some mechanism to recycle NAD+ from NADH, glycolysis would 
soon deplete the cell's pool of NAD+ by reducing it all to NADH and would shut itself down for lack of an oxidizing agent. Under aerobic conditions, NAD+ is recycled from NADH by the transfer of electrons to the electron transport chain. An anaerobic alternative is to transfer electrons from NADH to pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis.</justification>

        <justification>A key difference among the three pathways is the contrasting mechanisms for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which is required to sustain glycolysis. In fermentation, the final electron acceptor is an organic molecule such as pyruvate (lactic acid fermentation) or acetaldehyde (alcohol fermentation). In cellular respiration, by contrast, electrons carried by NADH are transferred to an electron transport chain, where they move stepwise down a series of redox reactions to a final electron acceptor. In aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is oxygen; in anaerobic respiration, the final acceptor is another molecule that is electronegative (although invariably less so than oxygen). Passage of electrons from NADH to the electron transport chain not only regenerates the NAD+ required for glycolysis but pays an ATP bonus when the stepwise electron transport from this NADH to oxygen drives oxidative phosphorylation. An even bigger ATP payoff comes from the oxidation of pyruvate in the 
mitochondrion, which is unique to respiration. Without an electron transport chain, the energy still stored in pyruvate is unavailable to most cells. Thus, cellular respiration harvests much more energy from each sugar molecule than fermentation can. In fact, aerobic respiration yields up to 16 times as much ATP per glucose molecule as does fermentation: up to 32 molecules of ATP for respiration, compared with 2 molecules of ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation in fermentation.</justification>

In anaerobic respiration, an electron transport chain is present with a final electron acceptor other than oxygen. In fermentation, the electrons from NADH are passed to pyruvate or a derivative of pyruvate, regenerating the NAD+ required to oxidize more glucose. Two common types of fermentation are alcohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation. Fermentation and anaerobic or aerobic respiration all use glycolysis to oxidize glucose, but they differ in their final electron acceptor and whether an electron transport chain is used (respiration) or not (fermentation). Respiration yields more ATP; aerobic respiration, with O2 as the final electron acceptor, yields about 16 times as much ATP as does

        <justification>Potassium ions (K+) and sodium ions (Na+) play an essential role in the formation of the resting potential. Each type of ion has a concentration gradient across the plasma membrane of a neuron (Table 48.1). In the case of mammalian neurons, the concentration of K+ is highest inside the cell, while the concentration of Na+ is highest outside. These Na+ and K+ gradients are maintained by sodium-potassium pumps in the plasma membrane. As discussed in Chapter 7, these ion pumps use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to actively transport Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell (Figure 48.7). There are also concentration gradients for chloride ions (Cl-') and other anions, as shown in Table 48.1, but we will ignore these for the moment. Table 48.1 Ion Concentrations Inside and Outside of Mammalian Neurons Ion Intracellular Concentration (mM) Extracellular Concentration (mM) Potassium (K+) 140 5 Sodium (Na+) 15 150 Chloride (Cl-') 10 120 Large anions (A-') inside cell, such as proteins 100 (not 
applicable) Figure 48.7 The basis of the membrane potential. The sodium-potassium pump generates and maintains the ionic gradients of Na+ and K+ shown in Table 48.1. The pump uses ATP to actively transport Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell. Although there is a substantial concentration gradient of sodium across the membrane, very little net diffusion of Na+ occurs because there are very few open sodium channels. In contrast, the large number of open potassium channels allow a significant net outflow of K+. Because the membrane is only weakly permeable to chloride and other anions, this outflow of K+ results in a net negative charge inside the cell. A sodium-potassium pump transports three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions that it transports in. Although this pumping generates a net export of positive charge, the resulting voltage difference is only a few millivolts. Why, then, is there a voltage difference of 60-80 mV in a resting neuron? The answer lies in ion movement through 
ion channels, pores formed by clusters of specialized proteins that span the membrane. Ion channels allow ions to diffuse back and forth across the membrane. As ions diffuse through channels, they carry with them units of electrical charge. Any resulting net movement of positive or negative charge will generate a membrane potential, or voltage across the membrane. The concentration gradients of K+ and Na+ across the plasma membrane represent a chemical form of potential energy. The ion channels that convert this chemical potential energy to electrical potential energy can do so because they have selective permeability, allowing only certain ions to pass. For example, a potassium channel allows K+ to diffuse freely across the membrane, but not other ions, such as Na+. Diffusion of K+ through open potassium channels is critical for formation of the resting potential. The K+ concentration is 140 mM inside the cell, but only 5 mM outside. The chemical concentration gradient thus favors a net outflow of K+. 
Furthermore, a resting neuron has many open potassium channels, but very few open sodium channels (see Figure 48.7). Because Na+ and other ions can't readily cross the membrane, K+ outflow leads to a net negative charge inside the cell. This buildup of negative charge within the neuron is the major source of the membrane potential. What stops the buildup of negative charge? The excess negative charges inside the cell exert an attractive force that opposes the flow of additional positively charged potassium ions out of the cell. The separation of charge (voltage) thus results in an electrical gradient that counterbalances the chemical concentration gradient of K+.</justification>

        <justification>To explore how the membrane potential changes, let's consider what happens when gated potassium channels that are closed in a resting neuron are stimulated to open. Opening these potassium channels increases the membrane's permeability to K+. Net diffusion of K+ out of the neuron increases, shifting the membrane potential toward EK (-'90 mV at 37 degree C). This increase in the magnitude of the membrane potential, called a hyperpolarization, makes the inside of the membrane more negative (Figure 48.10a). In a resting neuron, hyperpolarization results from any stimulus that increases the outflow of positive ions or the inflow of negative ions. Although opening potassium channels in a resting neuron causes hyperpolarization, opening some other types of ion channels has an opposite effect, making the inside of the membrane less negative (Figure 48.10b).</justification>

        <justification>The characteristic shape of the graph of an action potential (see Figure 48.10c) reflects the large change in membrane potential resulting from ion movement through voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels. Membrane depolarization opens both types of channels, but they respond independently and sequentially. Sodium channels open first, initiating the action potential. As the action potential proceeds, the sodium channels become inactivated: A loop of the channel protein moves, blocking ion flow through the opening. Sodium channels remain inactivated until after the membrane returns to the resting potential and the channels close. Potassium channels open more slowly than sodium channels, but remain open and functional until the end of the action potential. Figure 48.11 The role of voltage-gated ion channels in the generation of an action potential. The circled numbers on the graph in the center and the colors of the action potential phases correspond to the five diagrams showing 
voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels in a neuron's plasma membrane. (Ungated ion channels are not illustrated. ) To understand further how voltage-gated channels shape the action potential, we'll consider the process as a series of stages (Figure 48.11). &amp;#x278A; When the membrane of the axon is at the resting potential, most voltage-gated sodium channels are closed. Some potassium channels are open, but most voltage-gated potassium channels are closed. &amp;#x278B; When a stimulus depolarizes the membrane, some gated sodium channels open, allowing more Na+ to diffuse into the cell. The Na+ inflow causes further depolarization, which opens still more gated sodium channels, allowing even more Na+ to diffuse into the cell. &amp;#x278C; Once the threshold is crossed, the positive-feedback cycle rapidly brings the membrane potential close to ENa. This stage of the action potential is called the rising phase. &amp;#x278D; Two events prevent the membrane potential from actually reaching ENa: Voltage-
gated sodium channels inactivate soon after opening, halting Na+ inflow; and most voltage-gated potassium channels open, causing a rapid outflow of K+. Both events quickly bring the membrane potential back toward EK. This stage is called the falling phase. &amp;#x278E; In the final phase of an action potential, called the undershoot, the membrane's permeability to K+ is higher than at rest, so the membrane potential is closer to EK than it is at the resting potential. The gated potassium channels eventually close, and the membrane potential returns to the resting potential.</justification>

        <justification>48.3 Action potentials are the signals conducted by axons (pp. 1050-1055) Neurons have gated ion channels that open or close in response to stimuli, leading to changes in the membrane potential. An increase in the magnitude of the membrane potential is a hyperpolarization; a decrease is a depolarization. Changes in membrane potential that vary continuously with the strength of a stimulus are known as graded potentials. An action potential is a brief, all-or-none depolarization of a neuron's plasma membrane. When a graded depolarization brings the membrane potential to the threshold, many voltage-gated ion channels open, triggering an inflow of Na+ that rapidly brings the membrane potential to a positive value. A negative membrane potential is restored by the inactivation of sodium channels and by the opening of many voltage-gated potassium channels, which increases K+ outflow.</justification>

        <justification>To explain the behavior of a cell in a solution, we must consider both solute concentration and membrane permeability. Both factors are taken into account in the concept of tonicity, the ability of a surrounding solution to cause a cell to gain or lose water. The tonicity of a solution depends in part on its concentration of solutes that cannot cross the membrane (nonpenetrating solutes) relative to that inside the cell. If there is a higher concentration of nonpenetrating solutes in the surrounding solution, water will tend to leave the cell, and vice versa. Figure 7.15 The water balance of living cells. How living cells react to changes in the solute concentration of their environment depends on whether or not they have cell walls. (a) Animal cells, such as this red blood cell, do not have cell walls. (b) Plant cells do. (Arrows indicate net water movement after the cells were first placed in these solutions. ) If a cell without a wall, such as an animal cell, is immersed in an 
environment that is isotonic to the cell (iso means "same"), there will be no net movement of water across the plasma membrane. Water diffuses across the membrane, but at the same rate in both directions. In an isotonic environment, the volume of an animal cell is stable (Figure 7.15a, on the next page). Now let's transfer the cell to a solution that is hypertonic to the cell (hyper means "more," in this case referring to nonpenetrating solutes). The cell will lose water, shrivel, and probably die. This is one way an increase in the salinity (saltiness) of a lake can kill animals there; if the lake water becomes hypertonic to the animals' cells, the cells might shrivel and die. However, taking up too much water can be just as hazardous to an animal cell as losing water. If we place the cell in a solution that is hypotonic to the cell (hypo means "less"), water will enter the cell faster than it leaves, and the cell will swell and lyse (burst) like an overfilled water balloon.</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Cell membranes are permeable to specific ions and a variety of polar molecules. These hydrophilic substances can avoid contact with the lipid bilayer by passing through transport proteins that span the membrane. Some transport proteins, called channel proteins, function by having a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or atomic ions use as a tunnel through the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, left). For example, the passage of water molecules through the membrane in certain cells is greatly facilitated by channel proteins known as aquaporins. Each aquaporin allows entry of up to 3 billion (3 * 109) water molecules per second, passing single file through its central channel, which fits ten at a time. Without aquaporins, only a tiny fraction of these water molecules would pass through the same area of the cell membrane in a second, so the channel protein brings about a tremendous increase in rate. Other transport proteins, called carrier proteins, hold onto their passengers and change 
shape in a way that shuttles them across the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, right). A transport protein is specific for the substance it translocates (moves), allowing only a certain substance (or a small group of related substances) to cross the membrane. For example, a specific carrier protein in the plasma membrane of red blood cells transports glucose across the membrane 50,000 times faster than glucose can pass through on its own. This "glucose transporter" is so selective that it even rejects fructose, a structural isomer of glucose. Thus, the selective permeability of a membrane depends on both the discriminating barrier of the lipid bilayer and the specific transport proteins built into the membrane.</justification>

        <justification>Let's look more closely at how water and certain hydrophilic solutes cross a membrane. As mentioned earlier, many polar molecules and ions impeded by the lipid bilayer of the membrane diffuse passively with the help of transport proteins that span the membrane. This phenomenon is called facilitated diffusion. Cell biologists are still trying to learn exactly how various transport proteins facilitate diffusion. Most transport proteins are very specific: They transport some substances but not others. Figure 7.17 Two types of transport proteins that carry out facilitated diffusion. In both cases, the protein can transport the solute in either direction, but the net movement is down the concentration gradient of the solute. As described earlier, the two types of transport proteins are channel proteins and carrier proteins. Channel proteins simply provide corridors that allow specific molecules or ions to cross the membrane (Figure 7.17a). The hydrophilic passageways provided by these 
proteins can allow water molecules or small ions to diffuse very quickly from one side of the membrane to the other. Aquaporins, the water channel proteins, facilitate the massive amounts of diffusion that occur in plant cells and in animal cells such as red blood cells (see Figure 7.15). Certain kidney cells also have a high number of aquaporins, allowing them to reclaim water from urine before it is excreted. If the kidneys did not perform this function, you would excrete about 180 L of urine per day: and have to drink an equal volume of water! Channel proteins that transport ions are called ion channels. Many ion channels function as gated channels, which open or close in response to a stimulus. For some gated channels, the stimulus is electrical. The ion channel shown in Figure 7.1, for example, opens in response to an electrical stimulus, allowing potassium ions to leave the cell. Other gated channels open or close when a specific substance other than the one to be transported binds to the channel. Both 
types of gated channels are important in the functioning of the nervous system, as you'll learn in Chapter 48. Carrier proteins, such as the glucose transporter mentioned earlier, seem to undergo a subtle change in shape that somehow translocates the solute-binding site across the membrane (Figure 7.17b). Such a change in shape may be triggered by the binding and release of the transported molecule. Like ion channels, carrier proteins involved in facilitated diffusion result in the net movement of a substance down its concentration gradient. No energy input is thus required: This is passive transport.</justification>

        <justification>Cotransport: Coupled Transport by a Membrane Protein Despite the help of transport proteins, facilitated diffusion is considered passive transport because the solute is moving down its concentration gradient, a process that requires no energy. Facilitated diffusion speeds transport of a solute by providing efficient passage through the membrane, but it does not alter the direction of transport. Some transport proteins, however, can move solutes against their concentration gradients, across the plasma membrane from the side where they are less concentrated (whether inside or outside) to the side where they are more concentrated.</justification>

        <justification>To pump a solute across a membrane against its gradient requires work; the cell must expend energy. Therefore, this type of membrane traffic is called active transport. The transport proteins that move solutes against their concentration gradients are all carrier proteins rather than channel proteins. This makes sense because when channel proteins are open, they merely allow solutes to diffuse down their concentration gradients rather than picking them up and transporting them against their gradients. Figure 7.18 The sodium-potassium pump: a specific case of active transport. This transport system pumps ions against steep concentration gradients: Sodium ion concentration ([Na+]) is high outside the cell and low inside, while potassium ion concentration ([K+]) is low outside the cell and high inside. The pump oscillates between two shapes in a cycle that moves 3 Na+ out of the cell for every 2 K+ pumped into the cell. The two shapes have different affinities for Na+ and K+. ATP powers 
the shape change by transferring a phosphate group to the transport protein (phosphorylating the protein). Active transport enables a cell to maintain internal concentrations of small solutes that differ from concentrations in its environment. For example, compared with its surroundings, an animal cell has a much higher concentration of potassium ions (K+) and a much lower concentration of sodium ions (Na+). The plasma membrane helps maintain these steep gradients by pumping Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell.</justification>

A proton pump translocates positive charge in the form of hydrogen ions. The voltage and H+ concentration gradient represent a dual energy source that can drive other processes, such as the uptake of nutrients. Most proton pumps are powered by ATP. Some membrane proteins that actively transport ions contribute to the membrane potential. An example is the sodium-potassium pump. Notice in Figure 7.18 that the pump does not translocate Na+ and K+ one for one, but pumps three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions it pumps into the cell. With each "crank" of the pump, there is a net transfer of one positive charge from the cytoplasm to the extracellular fluid, a process that stores energy as voltage. A transport protein that generates voltage across a membrane is called an electrogenic pump. The sodium-potassium pump appears to be 
the major electrogenic pump of animal cells. The main electrogenic pump of plants, fungi, and bacteria is a proton pump, which actively transports protons (hydrogen ions, H+) out of the cell. The pumping of H+ transfers positive charge from the cytoplasm to the extracellular solution (Figure 7.20). By generating voltage across membranes, electrogenic pumps help store energy that can be tapped for cellular work. One important use of proton gradients in the cell is for ATP synthesis during cellular respiration, as you will see in Chapter 9. Another is a type of membrane traffic called cotransport.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>A carrier protein, such as this sucrose-H+ cotransporter in a plant cell, is able to use the diffusion of H+ down its electrochemical gradient into the cell to drive the uptake of sucrose. The H+ gradient is maintained by an ATP-driven proton pump that concentrates H+ outside the cell, thus storing potential energy that can be used for active transport, in this case of sucrose. Thus, ATP indirectly provides the energy necessary for cotransport. (The cell wall is not shown. ) A single ATP-powered pump that transports a specific solute can indirectly drive the active transport of several other solutes in a mechanism called cotransport. A substance that has been pumped across a membrane can do work as it moves back across the membrane by diffusion, analogous to water that has been pumped uphill and performs work as it flows back down. Another transport protein, a cotransporter separate from the pump, can couple the "downhill" diffusion of this substance to the "uphill" transport of a 
second substance against its own concentration (or electrochemical) gradient. For example, a plant cell uses the gradient of H+ generated by its proton pumps to drive the active transport of amino acids, sugars, and several other nutrients into the cell. One transport protein couples the return of H+ to the transport of sucrose into the cell (Figure 7.21). This protein can translocate sucrose into the cell against a concentration gradient, but only if the sucrose molecule travels in the company of a hydrogen ion. The hydrogen ion uses the transport protein as an avenue to diffuse down the electrochemical gradient maintained by the proton pump.</justification>

A metabolic sequence called beta oxidation breaks the fatty acids down to two-carbon fragments, which enter the citric acid cycle as acetyl CoA. NADH and FADH2 are also generated during beta oxidation; they can enter the electron transport chain, leading to further ATP production. Fats make excellent fuel, in large part due to their chemical structure and the high energy level of their electrons (equally shared between carbon and hydrogen) compared to those of carbohydrates. A gram of fat oxidized by respiration produces more than twice as much ATP as a gram of carbohydrate.

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Molecules have a type of energy called thermal energy (heat), due to their constant motion. One result of this motion is diffusion, the movement of molecules of any substance so that they spread out evenly into the available space. Each molecule moves randomly, yet diffusion of a population of molecules may be directional. To understand this process, let's imagine a synthetic membrane separating pure water from a solution of a dye in water. Study Figure 7.13a carefully to appreciate how diffusion would result in both solutions having equal concentrations of the dye molecules. Once that point is reached, there will be a dynamic equilibrium, with as many dye molecules crossing the membrane each second in one direction as in the other. We can now state a simple rule of diffusion: In the absence of other forces, a substance will diffuse from where it is more concentrated to where it is less concentrated. Put another way, any substance will diffuse down its concentration gradient, the 
region along which the density of a chemical substance increases or decreases (in this case, decreases). No work must be done to make this happen; diffusion is a spontaneous process, needing no input of energy. Note that each substance diffuses down its own concentration gradient, unaffected by the concentration gradients of other substances (Figure 7.13b).</justification>

        <justification>The bonds between the phosphate groups of ATP can be broken by hydrolysis. When the terminal phosphate bond is broken by addition of a water molecule, a molecule of inorganic phosphate (HOPO32-, abbreviated &amp;#9413;i throughout this book) leaves the ATP, which becomes adenosine diphosphate, or ADP (Figure 8.8b). The reaction is exergonic and releases 7.3 kcal of energy per mole of ATP hydrolyzed: ATP + H2O &amp;rarr; ADP + &amp;#9413;i &amp;Delta;G = -'7.3 kcal/mol (-'30.5 kJ/mol) This is the free-energy change measured under standard conditions. In the cell, conditions do not conform to standard conditions, primarily because reactant and product concentrations differ from 1 M. For example, when ATP hydrolysis occurs under cellular conditions, the actual deltaG is about -'13 kcal/mol, 78% greater than the energy released by ATP hydrolysis under standard conditions. Because their hydrolysis releases energy, the phosphate bonds of ATP are sometimes referred to as high-energy phosphate 
bonds, but the term is misleading. The phosphate bonds of ATP are not unusually strong bonds, as "high-energy" may imply; rather, the reactants (ATP and water) themselves have high energy relative to the energy of the products (ADP and &amp;#9413;i). The release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change to a state of lower free energy, not from the phosphate bonds themselves. ATP is useful to the cell because the energy it releases on losing a phosphate group is somewhat greater than the energy most other molecules could deliver. But why does this hydrolysis release so much energy? If we reexamine the ATP molecule in Figure 8.8a, we can see that all three phosphate groups are negatively charged. These like charges are crowded together, and their mutual repulsion contributes to the instability of this region of the ATP molecule. The triphosphate tail of ATP is the chemical equivalent of a compressed spring.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 8.11 The ATP cycle. Energy released by breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell is used to phosphorylate ADP, regenerating ATP. Chemical potential energy stored in ATP drives most cellular work. An organism at work uses ATP continuously, but ATP is a renewable resource that can be regenerated by the addition of phosphate to ADP (Figure 8.11). The free energy required to phosphorylate ADP comes from exergonic breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell. This shuttling of inorganic phosphate and energy is called the ATP cycle, and it couples the cell's energy-yielding (exergonic) processes to the energy-consuming (endergonic) ones. The ATP cycle proceeds at an astonishing pace. For example, a working muscle cell recycles its entire pool of ATP in less than a minute. That turnover represents 10 million molecules of ATP consumed and regenerated per second per cell. If ATP could not be regenerated by the phosphorylation of ADP, humans would use up nearly their body weight in ATP 
each day. Because both directions of a reversible process cannot be downhill, the regeneration of ATP from ADP and &amp;#9413;i is necessarily endergonic: ADP + &amp;#9413;i &amp;rarr; ATP + H2O &amp;Delta;G = +7.3 kcal/mol (+30.5 kJ/mol) (standard conditions) Since ATP formation from ADP and &amp;#9413;i is not spontaneous, free energy must be spent to make it occur. Catabolic (exergonic) pathways, especially cellular respiration, provide the energy for the endergonic process of making ATP. Plants also use light energy to produce ATP. Thus, the ATP cycle is a revolving door through which energy passes during its transfer from catabolic to anabolic pathways.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Scientists have tried for centuries to piece together the process by which plants make food. Although some of the steps are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 1800s: In the presence of light, the green parts of plants produce organic compounds and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. Using molecular formulas, we can summarize the complex series of chemical reactions in photosynthesis with this chemical equation: 6 CO2 + 12 H2O + Light energy &amp;rarr; C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 6 H2O We use glucose (C6H12O6) here to simplify the relationship between photosynthesis and respiration, but the direct product of photosynthesis is actually a three-carbon sugar that can be used to make glucose. Water appears on both sides of the equation because 12 molecules are consumed and 6 molecules are newly formed during photosynthesis. We can simplify the equation by indicating only the net consumption of water: 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + Light energy &amp;rarr; 
C6H12O6 + 6 O2 Writing the equation in this form, we can see that the overall chemical change during photosynthesis is the reverse of the one that occurs during cellular respiration. Both of these metabolic processes occur in plant cells. However, as you will soon learn, chloroplasts do not synthesize sugars by simply reversing the steps of respiration.</justification>

    <text>How is the proton gradient in respiration generated during chemiosmosis?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>How does the inner mitochondrial membrane or the prokaryotic plasma membrane generate and maintain the H+ gradient that drives ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase protein complex? Establishing the H+ gradient is a major function of the electron transport chain, which is shown in its mitochondrial location in Figure 9.15. The chain is an energy converter that uses the exergonic flow of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to pump H+ across the membrane, from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. The H+ has a tendency to move back across the membrane, diffusing down its gradient. And the ATP synthases are the only sites that provide a route through the membrane for H+. As we described previously, the passage of H+ through ATP synthase uses the exergonic flow of H+ to drive the phosphorylation of ADP. Thus, the energy stored in an H+ gradient across a membrane couples the redox reactions of the electron transport chain to ATP synthesis, an example of chemiosmosis. At this point, 
you may be wondering how the electron transport chain pumps hydrogen ions. Researchers have found that certain members of the electron transport chain accept and release protons (H+) along with electrons. (The aqueous solutions inside and surrounding the cell are a ready source of H+. ) At certain steps along the chain, electron transfers cause H+ to be taken up and released into the surrounding solution. In eukaryotic cells, the electron carriers are spatially arranged in the inner mitochondrial membrane in such a way that H+ is accepted from the mitochondrial matrix and deposited in the intermembrane space (see Figure 9.15). The H+ gradient that results is referred to as a proton-motive force, emphasizing the capacity of the gradient to perform work. The force drives H+ back across the membrane through the H+ channels provided by ATP synthases. In general terms, chemiosmosis is an energy-coupling mechanism that uses energy stored in the form of an H+ gradient across a membrane to drive cellular work.</justification>

        <justification>There are three reasons we cannot state an exact number of ATP molecules generated by the breakdown of one molecule of glucose. First, phosphorylation and the redox reactions are not directly coupled to each other, so the ratio of the number of NADH molecules to the number of ATP molecules is not a whole number. We know that 1 NADH results in 10 H+ being transported out across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but the exact number of H+ that must reenter the mitochondrial matrix via ATP synthase to generate 1 ATP has long been debated. Based on experimental data, however, most biochemists now agree that the most accurate number is 4 H+. Therefore, a single molecule of NADH generates enough proton-motive force for the synthesis of 2.5 ATP. The citric acid cycle also supplies electrons to the electron transport chain via FADH2, but since its electrons enter later in the chain, each molecule of this electron carrier is responsible for transport of only enough H+ for the synthesis of 1.5 
ATP.</justification>

        <justification>The harvesting of energy from glucose by cellular respiration is a cumulative function of three metabolic stages: Biochemists usually reserve the term cellular respiration for stages 2 and 3. We include glycolysis, however, because most respiring cells deriving energy from glucose use glycolysis to produce the starting material for the citric acid cycle. Figure 9.6 An overview of cellular respiration. During glycolysis, each glucose molecule is broken down into two molecules of the compound pyruvate. In eukaryotic cells, as shown here, the pyruvate enters the mitochondrion. There it is oxidized to acetyl CoA, which is further oxidized to CO2 in the citric acid cycle. NADH and a similar electron carrier, a coenzyme called FADH2, transfer electrons derived from glucose to electron transport chains, which are built into the inner mitochondrial membrane. (In prokaryotes, the electron transport chains are located in the plasma membrane. ) During oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport 
chains convert the chemical energy to a form used for ATP synthesis in the process called chemiosmosis. As diagrammed in Figure 9.6, glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation followed by the citric acid cycle are the catabolic pathways that break down glucose and other organic fuels. Glycolysis, which occurs in the cytosol, begins the degradation process by breaking glucose into two molecules of a compound called pyruvate. In eukaryotes, pyruvate enters the mitochondrion and is oxidized to a compound called acetyl CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle. There, the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide is completed. (In prokaryotes, these processes take place in the cytosol. ) Thus, the carbon dioxide produced by respiration represents fragments of oxidized organic molecules.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 9.10 Oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the step before the citric acid cycle. Pyruvate is a charged molecule, so in eukaryotic cells it must enter the mitochondrion via active transport, with the help of a transport protein. Next, a complex of several enzymes (the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) catalyzes the three numbered steps, which are described in the text. The acetyl group of acetyl CoA will enter the citric acid cycle. The CO2 molecule will diffuse out of the cell. By convention, coenzyme A is abbreviated S-CoA when it is attached to a molecule, emphasizing the sulfur atom (S). Upon entering the mitochondrion via active transport, pyruvate is first converted to a compound called acetyl coenzyme A, or acetyl CoA (Figure 9.10). This step, linking glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, is carried out by a multienzyme complex that catalyzes three reactions: &amp;#x278A; Pyruvate's carboxyl group (: COO-'), which is already fully oxidized and thus has little chemical energy,
 is removed and given off as a molecule of CO2. (This is the first step in which CO2 is released during respiration. ) &amp;#x278B; The remaining two-carbon fragment is oxidized, forming acetate (CH3COO-', the ionized form of acetic acid). The extracted electrons are transferred to NAD+, storing energy in the form of NADH. &amp;#x278C; Finally, coenzyme A (CoA), a sulfur-containing compound derived from a B vitamin, is attached via its sulfur atom to the acetate, forming acetyl CoA, which has a high potential energy; in other words, the reaction of acetyl CoA to yield lower-energy products is highly exergonic. This molecule will now feed its acetyl group into the citric acid cycle for further oxidation.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 9.11 An overview of pyruvate oxidation and the citric acid cycle. The inputs and outputs per pyruvate molecule are shown. To calculate on a per-glucose basis, multiply by 2, because each glucose molecule is split during glycolysis into two pyruvate molecules. The citric acid cycle is also called the tricarboxylic acid cycle or the Krebs cycle, the latter honoring Hans Krebs, the German-British scientist who was largely responsible for working out the pathway in the 1930s. The cycle functions as a metabolic furnace that oxidizes organic fuel derived from pyruvate. Figure 9.11 summarizes the inputs and outputs as pyruvate is broken down to three CO2 molecules, including the molecule of CO2 released during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. The cycle generates 1 ATP per turn by substrate-level phosphorylation, but most of the chemical energy is transferred to NAD+ and a related electron carrier, the coenzyme FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide, derived from riboflavin, a B 
vitamin), during the redox reactions. The reduced coenzymes, NADH and FADH2, shuttle their cargo of high-energy electrons into the electron transport chain. Figure 9.12 A closer look at the citric acid cycle. In the chemical structures, red type traces the fate of the two carbon atoms that enter the cycle via acetyl CoA (step 1), and blue type indicates the two carbons that exit the cycle as CO2 in steps 3 and 4. (The red labeling goes only through step 5 because the succinate molecule is symmetrical; the two ends cannot be distinguished from each other. ) Notice that the carbon atoms that enter the cycle from acetyl CoA do not leave the cycle in the same turn. They remain in the cycle, occupying a different location in the molecules on their next turn, after another acetyl group is added. As a consequence, the oxaloacetate that is regenerated at step 8 is composed of different carbon atoms each time around. In eukaryotic cells, all the citric acid cycle enzymes are located in the mitochondrial matrix except 
for the enzyme that catalyzes step 6, which resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Carboxylic acids are represented in their ionized forms, as : COO-', because the ionized forms prevail at the pH within the mitochondrion. For example, citrate is the ionized form of citric acid. Now let's look at the citric acid cycle in more detail. The cycle has eight steps, each catalyzed by a specific enzyme. You can see in Figure 9.12 that for each turn of the citric acid cycle, two carbons (red) enter in the relatively reduced form of an acetyl group (step 1), and two different carbons (blue) leave in the completely oxidized form of CO2 molecules (steps 3 and 4).</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>The cells of plants, prokaryotes, fungi, and some protists are surrounded by walls (see Figure 6.28). When such a cell is immersed in a hypotonic solution: bathed in rainwater, for example: the wall helps maintain the cell's water balance. Consider a plant cell. Like an animal cell, the plant cell swells as water enters by osmosis (Figure 7.15b). However, the relatively inelastic wall will expand only so much before it exerts a back pressure on the cell, called turgor pressure, that opposes further water uptake. At this point, the cell is turgid (very firm), which is the healthy state for most plant cells. Plants that are not woody, such as most houseplants, depend for mechanical support on cells kept turgid by a surrounding hypotonic solution. If a plant's cells and their surroundings are isotonic, there is no net tendency for water to enter, and the cells become flaccid (limp). However, a wall is of no advantage if the cell is immersed in a hypertonic environment. In this case, a 
plant cell, like an animal cell, will lose water to its surroundings and shrink. As the plant cell shrivels, its plasma membrane pulls away from the wall. This phenomenon, called plasmolysis, causes the plant to wilt and can lead to plant death. The walled cells of bacteria and fungi also plasmolyze in hypertonic environments.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 7.20 A proton pump. Proton pumps are electrogenic pumps that store energy by generating voltage (charge separation) across membranes. A proton pump translocates positive charge in the form of hydrogen ions. The voltage and H+ concentration gradient represent a dual energy source that can drive other processes, such as the uptake of nutrients. Most proton pumps are powered by ATP. Some membrane proteins that actively transport ions contribute to the membrane potential. An example is the sodium-potassium pump. Notice in Figure 7.18 that the pump does not translocate Na+ and K+ one for one, but pumps three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions it pumps into the cell. With each "crank" of the pump, there is a net transfer of one positive charge from the cytoplasm to the extracellular fluid, a process that stores energy as voltage. A transport protein that generates voltage across a membrane is called an electrogenic pump. The sodium-potassium pump appears to be 
the major electrogenic pump of animal cells. The main electrogenic pump of plants, fungi, and bacteria is a proton pump, which actively transports protons (hydrogen ions, H+) out of the cell. The pumping of H+ transfers positive charge from the cytoplasm to the extracellular solution (Figure 7.20). By generating voltage across membranes, electrogenic pumps help store energy that can be tapped for cellular work. One important use of proton gradients in the cell is for ATP synthesis during cellular respiration, as you will see in Chapter 9.

Bacteriorhodopsin (a bacterial transport protein) has a distinct orientation in the membrane, with its N-terminus outside the cell and its C-terminus inside. This ribbon model highlights the ?-helical secondary structure of the hydrophobic parts, which lie mostly within the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. The protein includes 
seven transmembrane helices. The nonhelical hydrophilic segments are in contact with the aqueous solutions on the extracellular and cytoplasmic sides of the membrane. Notice in Figure 7.5 that there are two major populations of membrane proteins: integral proteins and peripheral proteins. Integral proteins penetrate the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer. The majority are transmembrane proteins, which span the membrane; other integral proteins extend only partway into the hydrophobic interior. The hydrophobic regions of an integral protein consist of one or more stretches of nonpolar amino acids (see Figure 5.16), usually coiled into ? helices (Figure 7.9). The hydrophilic parts of the molecule are exposed to the aqueous solutions on either side of the membrane. Some proteins also have a hydrophilic channel through their center that allows passage of hydrophilic substances (see Figure 7.1). Peripheral proteins are not embedded in the lipid bilayer at all; they are appendages loosely bound to the 
surface of the membrane, often to exposed parts of integral proteins (see Figure 7.5). On the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, some membrane proteins are held in place by attachment to the cytoskeleton. And on the extracellular side, certain membrane proteins are attached to fibers of the extracellular matrix (see Figure 6.30; integrins are one type of integral protein). These attachments combine to give animal cells a stronger framework than the plasma membrane alone could provide.</justification>

        <justification>Although very different in mechanism, aerobic respiration is in principle similar to the combustion of gasoline in an automobile engine after oxygen is mixed with the fuel (hydrocarbons). Food provides the fuel for respiration, and the exhaust is carbon dioxide and water. The overall process can be summarized as follows: Organic Carbon compounds + Oxygen S dioxide + Water + Energy Although carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be processed and consumed as fuel, it is helpful to learn the steps of cellular respiration by tracking the degradation of the sugar glucose (C6H12O6): C6H12O6 + 6 O2 &amp;rarr; 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + Energy (ATP + heat) Glucose is the fuel that cells most often use; we will discuss other organic molecules contained in foods later in the chapter.</justification>

        <justification>The oxidation of methane by oxygen is the main combustion reaction that occurs at the burner of a gas stove. The combustion of gasoline in an automobile engine is also a redox reaction; the energy released pushes the pistons. But the energy-yielding redox process of greatest interest to biologists is respiration: the oxidation of glucose and other molecules in food. Examine again the summary equation for cellular respiration, but this time think of it as a redox process: As in the combustion of methane or gasoline, the fuel (glucose) is oxidized and oxygen is reduced. The electrons lose potential energy along the way, and energy is released. In general, organic molecules that have an abundance of hydrogen are excellent fuels because their bonds are a source of "hilltop" electrons, whose energy may be released as these electrons "fall" down an energy gradient when they are transferred to oxygen. The summary equation for respiration indicates that hydrogen is transferred from glucose to 
oxygen. But the important point, not visible in the summary equation, is that the energy state of the electron changes as hydrogen (with its electron) is transferred to oxygen. In respiration, the oxidation of glucose transfers electrons to a lower energy state, liberating energy that becomes available for ATP synthesis. The main energy-yielding foods, carbohydrates and fats, are reservoirs of electrons associated with hydrogen. Only the barrier of activation energy holds back the flood of electrons to a lower energy state (see Figure 8.12). Without this barrier, a food substance like glucose would combine almost instantaneously with O2. If we supply the activation energy by igniting glucose, it burns in air, releasing 686 kcal (2,870 kJ) of heat per mole of glucose (about 180 g). Body temperature is not high enough to initiate burning, of course. Instead, if you swallow some glucose, enzymes in your cells will lower the barrier of activation energy, allowing the sugar to be oxidized in a series of steps.</justification>

        <justification>How do electrons that are extracted from glucose and stored as potential energy in NADH finally reach oxygen? It will help to compare the redox chemistry of cellular respiration to a much simpler reaction: the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water (Figure 9.5a). Mix H2 and O2, provide a spark for activation energy, and the gases combine explosively. In fact, combustion of liquid H2 and O2 is harnessed to power the main engines of the space shuttle after it is launched, boosting it into orbit. The explosion represents a release of energy as the electrons of hydrogen "fall" closer to the electronegative oxygen atoms. Cellular respiration also brings hydrogen and oxygen together to form water, but there are two important differences. First, in cellular respiration, the hydrogen that reacts with oxygen is derived from organic molecules rather than H2. Second, instead of occurring in one explosive reaction, respiration uses an electron transport chain to break the fall of 
electrons to oxygen into several energy-releasing steps (Figure 9.5b). An electron transport chain consists of a number of molecules, mostly proteins, built into the inner membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and the plasma membrane of aerobically respiring prokaryotes. Electrons removed from glucose are shuttled by NADH to the "top," higher-energy end of the chain. At the "bottom," lower-energy end, O2 captures these electrons along with hydrogen nuclei (H+), forming water.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Nonpolar molecules, such as hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and oxygen, are hydrophobic and can therefore dissolve in the lipid bilayer of the membrane and cross it easily, without the aid of membrane proteins. However, the hydrophobic interior of the membrane impedes the direct passage of ions and polar molecules, which are hydrophilic, through the membrane. Polar molecules such as glucose and other sugars pass only slowly through a lipid bilayer, and even water, an extremely small polar molecule, does not cross very rapidly. A charged atom or molecule and its surrounding shell of water (see Figure 3.7) find the hydrophobic interior of the membrane even more difficult to penetrate. Furthermore, the lipid bilayer is only one aspect of the gatekeeper system responsible for the selective permeability of a cell. Proteins built into the membrane play key roles in regulating transport.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Cell membranes are permeable to specific ions and a variety of polar molecules. These hydrophilic substances can avoid contact with the lipid bilayer by passing through transport proteins that span the membrane. Some transport proteins, called channel proteins, function by having a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or atomic ions use as a tunnel through the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, left). For example, the passage of water molecules through the membrane in certain cells is greatly facilitated by channel proteins known as aquaporins. Each aquaporin allows entry of up to 3 billion (3 * 109) water molecules per second, passing single file through its central channel, which fits ten at a time. Without aquaporins, only a tiny fraction of these water molecules would pass through the same area of the cell membrane in a second, so the channel protein brings about a tremendous increase in rate. Other transport proteins, called carrier proteins, hold onto their passengers and change 
shape in a way that shuttles them across the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, right). A transport protein is specific for the substance it translocates (moves), allowing only a certain substance (or a small group of related substances) to cross the membrane. For example, a specific carrier protein in the plasma membrane of red blood cells transports glucose across the membrane 50,000 times faster than glucose can pass through on its own. This "glucose transporter" is so selective that it even rejects fructose, a structural isomer of glucose. Thus, the selective permeability of a membrane depends on both the discriminating barrier of the lipid bilayer and the specific transport proteins built into the membrane.</justification>

This breakdown of glucose is exergonic, having a free-energy change of -'686 kcal (2,870 kJ) per mole of glucose decomposed (deltaG = -'686 kcal/mol). Recall that a negative deltaG indicates that the products of the chemical process store less energy than the reactants and that the reaction can happen spontaneously: in other words, without an input of energy. Catabolic pathways do not directly move flagella, pump solutes across membranes, polymerize monomers, or perform other cellular work. Catabolism is linked to work by a chemical drive shaft: ATP, which you learned about in Chapter 8. To keep 
working, the cell must regenerate its supply of ATP from ADP andi (see Figure 8.11). To understand how cellular respiration accomplishes this, let's examine the fundamental chemical processes known as oxidation and reduction.</justification>

The hydrogen atoms are not transferred directly to oxygen, but instead are usually passed first to an electron carrier, a coenzyme called NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, a derivative of the vitamin niacin).

Electron transfer from NADH to oxygen is an exergonic reaction with a free-energy change of -'53 kcal/mol (-'222 kJ/mol). Instead of this energy being released and wasted in a single explosive step, electrons cascade down the chain from one carrier molecule to the next in a series of redox reactions, losing a small amount of energy with each step until they finally reach oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor, which has a very great affinity for electrons. Each "downhill" carrier is more electronegative than, and thus capable of oxidizing, its "uphill" neighbor, with 
oxygen at the bottom of the chain. Therefore, the electrons removed from glucose by NAD+ fall down an energy gradient in the electron transport chain to a far more stable location in the electronegative oxygen atom. Put another way, oxygen pulls electrons down the chain in an energy-yielding tumble analogous to gravity pulling objects downhill. In summary, during cellular respiration, most electrons travel the following "downhill" route: glucose&amp;rarr; NADH&amp;rarr; electron transport chain&amp;rarr; oxygen.</justification>

        <justification>The harvesting of energy from glucose by cellular respiration is a cumulative function of three metabolic stages: Biochemists usually reserve the term cellular respiration for stages 2 and 3. We include glycolysis, however, because most respiring cells deriving energy from glucose use glycolysis to produce the starting material for the citric acid cycle. Figure 9.6 An overview of cellular respiration. During glycolysis, each glucose molecule is broken down into two molecules of the compound pyruvate. In eukaryotic cells, as shown here, the pyruvate enters the mitochondrion. There it is oxidized to acetyl CoA, which is further oxidized to CO2 in the citric acid cycle. NADH and a similar electron carrier, a coenzyme called FADH2, transfer electrons derived from glucose to electron transport chains, which are built into the inner mitochondrial membrane. (In prokaryotes, the electron transport chains are located in the plasma membrane. ) During oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport 
chains convert the chemical energy to a form used for ATP synthesis in the process called chemiosmosis. As diagrammed in Figure 9.6, glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation followed by the citric acid cycle are the catabolic pathways that break down glucose and other organic fuels. Glycolysis, which occurs in the cytosol, begins the degradation process by breaking glucose into two molecules of a compound called pyruvate. In eukaryotes, pyruvate enters the mitochondrion and is oxidized to a compound called acetyl CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle. There, the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide is completed. (In prokaryotes, these processes take place in the cytosol. ) Thus, the carbon dioxide produced by respiration represents fragments of oxidized organic molecules.</justification>

        <justification>Some of the steps of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are redox reactions in which dehydrogenases transfer electrons from substrates to NAD+, forming NADH. In the third stage of respiration, the electron transport chain accepts electrons from the breakdown products of the first two stages (most often via NADH) and passes these electrons from one molecule to another. At the end of the chain, the electrons are combined with molecular oxygen and hydrogen ions (H+), forming water (see Figure 9.5b). The energy released at each step of the chain is stored in a form the mitochondrion (or prokaryotic cell) can use to make ATP from ADP. This mode of ATP synthesis is called oxidative phosphorylation because it is powered by the redox reactions of the electron transport chain. Figure 9.7 Substrate-level phosphorylation. Some ATP is made by direct transfer of a phosphate group from an organic substrate to ADP by an enzyme. (For examples in glycolysis, see Figure 9.9, steps 7 and 10. ) In 
eukaryotic cells, the inner membrane of the mitochondrion is the site of electron transport and chemiosmosis, the processes that together constitute oxidative phosphorylation. (In prokaryotes, these processes take place in the plasma membrane. ) Oxidative phosphorylation accounts for almost 90% of the ATP generated by respiration. A smaller amount of ATP is formed directly in a few reactions of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle by a mechanism called substrate-level phosphorylation (Figure 9.7). This mode of ATP synthesis occurs when an enzyme transfers a phosphate group from a substrate molecule to ADP, rather than adding an inorganic phosphate to ADP as in oxidative phosphorylation. "Substrate molecule" here refers to an organic molecule generated as an intermediate during the catabolism of glucose. For each molecule of glucose degraded to carbon dioxide and water by respiration, the cell makes up to about 32 molecules of ATP, each with 7.3 kcal/mol of free energy. Respiration cashes in the large 
denomination of energy banked in a single molecule of glucose (686 kcal/mol) for the small change of many molecules of ATP, which is more practical for the cell to spend on its work.

In addition to these flies, Morgan had managed to obtain, through breeding, doubly mutant flies with black bodies and wings much smaller than normal, called vestigial wings. The mutant alleles are recessive to the wild-type alleles, and neither gene is on a sex chromosome. In his investigation of these two genes, Morgan carried out the crosses shown in Figure 15.9. The first was a P generation cross to generate F1 dihybrid flies, and the second was a testcross. Figure 15.9 Inquiry How does linkage between two genes affect inheritance of characters?

Sturtevant hypothesized that the percentage of recombinant offspring, the recombination frequency, calculated from experiments like the one in Figures 15.9 and 15.10, depends on the distance between genes on a chromosome. He assumed that crossing over is a random event, with the chance of crossing over approximately equal at all points along a chromosome. Based on these assumptions, Sturtevant predicted that the farther apart two genes are, the higher the probability that a crossover will occur between them and therefore the higher the recombination frequency.

As a consequence of the independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis, each of us produces a collection of gametes differing greatly in their combinations of the chromosomes we inherited from our two parents. Figure 13.10 suggests that each chromosome in a gamete is exclusively maternal or paternal in origin. In fact, this is not the case, because crossing over produces recombinant chromosomes, individual chromosomes that carry genes (DNA) derived from two different parents (Figure 13.11). In meiosis in humans, an average of one to three crossover events occur per chromosome pair, depending on the size of the chromosomes and the position of their centromeres. Crossing over begins very early in prophase I as homologous chromosomes pair loosely along their lengths. Each gene on one homolog is aligned precisely with the corresponding gene on the other homolog. In a single crossover event, the DNA of two nonsister chromatids: 
one maternal and one paternal chromatid of a homologous pair: is broken by specific proteins at precisely corresponding points, and the two segments beyond the crossover point are each joined to the other chromatid. Thus, a paternal chromatid is joined to a piece of maternal chromatid beyond the crossover point, and vice versa. In this way, crossing over produces chromosomes with new combinations of maternal and paternal alleles (see Figure 13.11).</justification>

        <justification>Now let's return to Morgan's fly room to see how we can explain the results of the Drosophila testcross illustrated in Figure 15.9. Recall that most of the offspring from the testcross for body color and wing size had parental phenotypes. That suggested that the two genes were on the same chromosome, since the occurrence of parental types with a frequency greater than 50% indicates that the genes are linked. About 17% of offspring, however, were recombinants. Faced with these results, Morgan proposed that some process must occasionally break the physical connection between specific alleles of genes on the same chromosome. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that this process, now called crossing over, accounts for the recombination of linked genes. In crossing over, which occurs while replicated homologous chromosomes are paired during prophase of meiosis I, a set of proteins orchestrates an exchange of corresponding segments of one maternal and one paternal chromatid (see Figure 13.11)

      <answer>
        <justification>Some genes on a chromosome are so far from each other that a crossover between them is virtually certain. The observed frequency of recombination in crosses involving two such genes can have a maximum value of 50%, a result indistinguishable from that for genes on different chromosomes. In this case, the physical connection between genes on the same chromosome is not reflected in the results of genetic crosses. Despite being on the same chromosome and thus being physically connected, the genes are genetically unlinked; alleles of such genes assort independently, as if they were on different chromosomes. In fact, at least two of the genes for pea characters that Mendel studied are now known to be on the same chromosome, but the distance between them is so great that linkage is not observed in genetic crosses. Consequently, the two genes behaved as if they were on different chromosomes in Mendel's experiments.</justification>

    <text>How can DNA polymerases be selective?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Enzymes called DNA polymerases catalyze the synthesis of new DNA by adding nucleotides to a preexisting chain. In E. coli, there are several different DNA polymerases, but two appear to play the major roles in DNA replication: DNA polymerase III and DNA polymerase I. The situation in eukaryotes is more complicated, with at least 11 different DNA polymerases discovered so far; however, the general principles are the same. Most DNA polymerases require a primer and a DNA template strand, along which complementary DNA nucleotides line up. In E. coli, DNA polymerase III (abbreviated DNA pol III) adds a DNA nucleotide to the RNA primer and then continues adding DNA nucleotides, complementary to the parental DNA template strand, to the growing end of the new DNA strand. The rate of elongation is about 500 nucleotides per second in bacteria and 50 per second in human cells. Figure 16.14 Incorporation of a nucleotide into a DNA strand. DNA polymerase catalyzes the addition of a nucleoside 
triphosphate to the 3' end of a growing DNA strand, with the release of two phosphates. Each nucleotide added to a growing DNA strand comes from a nucleoside triphosphate, which is a nucleoside (a sugar and a base) with three phosphate groups.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Because of their structure, DNA polymerases can add nucleotides only to the free 3' end of a primer or growing DNA strand, never to the 5' end (see Figure 16.14). Thus, a new DNA strand can elongate only in the 5' 3' direction. With this in mind, let's examine one of the two replication forks in a bubble (Figure 16.15). Along one template strand, DNA polymerase III can synthesize a complementary strand continuously by elongating the new DNA in the mandatory 5' 3' direction. DNA pol III remains in the replication fork on that template strand and continuously adds nucleotides to the new complementary strand as the fork progresses. The DNA strand made by this mechanism is called the leading strand. Only one primer is required for DNA pol III to synthesize the leading strand (see Figure 16.15). To elongate the other new strand of DNA in the mandatory 5' 3' direction, DNA pol III must work along the other template strand in the direction away from the replication fork. The DNA strand 
elongating in this direction is called the lagging strand. Synthesis of the leading strand and synthesis of the lagging strand occur concurrently and at the same rate.</justification>

        <justification>In spite of the impressive capabilities of DNA polymerases, there is a small portion of the cell's DNA that DNA polymerases can neither replicate nor repair. For linear DNA, such as the DNA of eukaryotic chromosomes, the fact that a DNA polymerase can add nucleotides only to the 3' end of a preexisting polynucleotide leads to what might appear to be a problem. The usual replication machinery provides no way to complete the 5' ends of daughter DNA strands. Even if an Okazaki fragment can be started with an RNA primer bound to the very end of the template strand, once that primer is removed, it cannot be replaced with DNA because there is no 3' end available for nucleotide addition (Figure 16.20). As a result, repeated rounds of replication produce shorter and shorter DNA molecules with uneven ("staggered") ends.</justification>

        <justification>This phenomenon, called incomplete dominance, is seen when red snapdragons are crossed with white snapdragons: All the F1 hybrids have pink flowers (Figure 14.10). This third, intermediate phenotype results from flowers of the heterozygotes having less red pigment than the red homozygotes. (This is unlike the case of Mendel's pea plants, where the Pp heterozygotes make enough pigment for the flowers to be purple, indistinguishable from those of PP plants. ) At first glance, incomplete dominance of either allele seems to provide evidence for the blending hypothesis of inheritance, which would predict that the red or white trait could never be retrieved from the pink hybrids. In fact, interbreeding F1 hybrids produces F2 offspring with a phenotypic ratio of one red to two pink to one white. (Because heterozygotes have a separate phenotype, the genotypic and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation are the same, 1:2:1. ) The segregation of the red-flower and white-flower alleles in the 
gametes produced by the pink-flowered plants confirms that the alleles for flower color are heritable factors that maintain their identity in the hybrids; that is, inheritance is particulate.</justification>

    <text>How do sodium ions get into the neuron?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>All cells have voltages across their plasma membranes. Voltage is electrical potential energy: a separation of opposite charges. The cytoplasmic side of the membrane is negative in charge relative to the extracellular side because of an unequal distribution of anions and cations on the two sides. The voltage across a membrane, called a membrane potential, ranges from about -'50 to -'200 millivolts (mV). (The minus sign indicates that the inside of the cell is negative relative to the outside. ) The membrane potential acts like a battery, an energy source that affects the traffic of all charged substances across the membrane. Because the inside of the cell is negative compared with the outside, the membrane potential favors the passive transport of cations into the cell and anions out of the cell. Thus, two forces drive the diffusion of ions across a membrane: a chemical force (the ion's concentration gradient) and an electrical force (the effect of the membrane potential on the ion's 
movement). This combination of forces acting on an ion is called the electrochemical gradient. In the case of ions, then, we must refine our concept of passive transport: An ion diffuses not simply down its concentration gradient but, more exactly, down its electrochemical gradient. For example, the concentration of Na+ inside a resting nerve cell is much lower than outside it. When the cell is stimulated, gated channels open that facilitate Na+ diffusion. Sodium ions then "fall" down their electrochemical gradient, driven by the concentration gradient of Na+ and by the attraction of these cations to the negative side (inside) of the membrane. In this example, both electrical and chemical contributions to the electrochemical gradient act in the same direction across the membrane, but this is not always so.</justification>

        <justification>Although opening potassium channels in a resting neuron causes hyperpolarization, opening some other types of ion channels has an opposite effect, making the inside of the membrane less negative (Figure 48.10b). A reduction in the magnitude of the membrane potential is called a depolarization. Depolarization in neurons often involves gated sodium channels. If a stimulus causes the gated sodium channels in a resting neuron to open, the membrane's permeability to Na+ increases. Na+ diffuses into the cell along its concentration gradient, causing a depolarization as the membrane potential shifts toward ENa (+62 mV at 37 degree C).</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Sometimes, the response to hyperpolarization or depolarization is simply a shift in the membrane potential. This shift, called a graded potential, has a magnitude that varies with the strength of the stimulus, with a larger stimulus causing a greater change in the membrane potential. Graded potentials induce a small electrical current that leaks out of the neuron as it flows along the membrane. Graded potentials thus decay with distance from their source. Although graded potentials are not the nerve signals that travel along axons, they have a major effect on the generation of nerve signals. If a depolarization shifts the membrane potential sufficiently, the result is a massive change in membrane voltage called an action potential. Unlike graded potentials, action potentials have a constant magnitude and can regenerate in adjacent regions of the membrane. Action potentials can therefore spread along axons, making them well suited for transmitting a signal over long distances. Action 
potentials arise because some of the ion channels in neurons are voltage-gated ion channels, opening or closing when the membrane potential passes a particular level. If a depolarization opens voltage-gated sodium channels, the resulting flow of Na+ into the neuron results in further depolarization. Because the sodium channels are voltage gated, an increased depolarization causes more sodium channels to open, leading to an even greater flow of current. The result is a process of positive feedback (see Figure 1.13) that triggers a very rapid opening of all voltage-gated sodium channels and the marked change in membrane potential that defines an action potential (Figure 48.10c). Action potentials occur whenever a depolarization increases the membrane voltage to a particular value, called the threshold. For mammalian neurons, the threshold is a membrane potential of about -'55 mV. Once initiated, the action potential has a magnitude that is independent of the strength of the triggering stimulus. Because action 
potentials occur fully or not at all, they represent an all-or-none response to stimuli. This all-or-none property reflects the fact that depolarization opens voltage-gated sodium channels, and the opening of sodium channels causes further depolarization. The positive-feedback loop of depolarization and channel opening triggers an action potential whenever the membrane potential reaches the threshold.</justification>

        <justification>48.3 Action potentials are the signals conducted by axons (pp. 1050-1055) Neurons have gated ion channels that open or close in response to stimuli, leading to changes in the membrane potential. An increase in the magnitude of the membrane potential is a hyperpolarization; a decrease is a depolarization. Changes in membrane potential that vary continuously with the strength of a stimulus are known as graded potentials. An action potential is a brief, all-or-none depolarization of a neuron's plasma membrane. When a graded depolarization brings the membrane potential to the threshold, many voltage-gated ion channels open, triggering an inflow of Na+ that rapidly brings the membrane potential to a positive value. A negative membrane potential is restored by the inactivation of sodium channels and by the opening of many voltage-gated potassium channels, which increases K+ outflow.</justification>

Third, cell proliferation triggered by activation greatly increases the number of B and T cells specific for an antigen.

        <justification>How does adaptive immunity distinguish self from nonself? Because antigen receptor genes are randomly rearranged, some immature lymphocytes produce receptors specific for epitopes on the organism's own molecules. If these self-reactive lymphocytes were not eliminated or inactivated, the immune system could not distinguish self from nonself and would attack body proteins, cells, and tissues. Instead, as lymphocytes mature in the bone marrow or thymus, their antigen receptors are tested for self-reactivity. Some B and T cells with receptors specific for the body's own molecules are destroyed by apoptosis, which is a programmed cell death (see Chapter 11). The remaining self-reactive lymphocytes are typically rendered nonfunctional, leaving only those that react to foreign molecules. Since the body normally lacks mature lymphocytes that can react against its own components, the immune system is said to exhibit self-tolerance.</justification>

At each catalytic step in the cascade, the number of activated products is much greater than in the preceding step. For example, in the epinephrine-triggered pathway in Figure 11.16, each adenylyl cyclase molecule catalyzes the formation of many cAMP molecules, each molecule of protein kinase A phosphorylates many molecules of the next kinase in the pathway, and so on. The amplification effect stems from the fact that these proteins persist in the active form long enough to process numerous molecules of substrate before they become inactive again. As a result of the signal's amplification, a small number of epinephrine molecules binding to receptors on the surface of a liver cell or muscle cell can lead to the release of hundreds of millions of glucose molecules from glycogen.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>The pain and swelling that alert you to a splinter under your skin are the result of a local inflammatory response, the changes brought about by signaling molecules released upon injury or infection (Figure 43.8). One important inflammatory signaling molecule is histamine, which is stored in the granules (vesicles) of mast cells, found in connective tissue. Histamine released at sites of damage triggers nearby blood vessels to dilate and become more permeable. Activated macrophages and neutrophils discharge cytokines, signaling molecules that enhance an immune response. These cytokines promote blood flow to the site of injury or infection. The increase in local blood supply causes the redness and increased skin temperature typical of the inflammatory response (from the Latin inflammare, to set on fire). Blood-engorged capillaries leak fluid into neighboring tissues, causing swelling. During inflammation, cycles of signaling and response transform the site. Activated complement proteins 
promote further release of histamine, attracting more phagocytic cells that enter injured tissues (see Figure 43.8) and carry out additional phagocytosis. At the same time, enhanced blood flow to the site helps deliver antimicrobial peptides. The result is an accumulation of pus, a fluid rich in white blood cells, dead pathogens, and cell debris from damaged tissue.</justification>

Ions and water rush into the cell, causing it to swell and lyse (Figure 43.19, right).

        <justification>Although errors in the completed DNA molecule amount to only one in 1010 (10 billion) nucleotides, initial pairing errors between incoming nucleotides and those in the template strand are 100,000 times more common: an error rate of one in 105 nucleotides. During DNA replication, DNA polymerases proofread each nucleotide against its template as soon as it is added to the growing strand. Upon finding an incorrectly paired nucleotide, the polymerase removes the nucleotide and then resumes synthesis.

    <text>How do acquired immune cells differ from innate immune cells?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>All animals have innate immunity, a defense that is active immediately upon infection and is the same whether or not the pathogen has been encountered previously. Innate immunity includes an outer covering, such as a skin or shell, that provides a significant barrier to entry by microbes. Sealing off the entire body surface is impossible, however, because gas exchange, nutrition, and reproduction require openings to the environment. Chemical secretions that trap or kill microbes guard the body's entrances and exits, while the linings of the digestive tract, airway, and other exchange surfaces provide additional barriers to infection. If a pathogen breaches barrier defenses and enters the body, the problem of how to fend off attack changes substantially. Housed within the body fluids and tissues, the invader is no longer an outsider. To fight infections, an animal's immune system must detect foreign particles and cells within the body. In other words, a properly functioning immune 
system distinguishes nonself from self. Detection of nonself is accomplished by molecular recognition, in which receptor molecules bind specifically to molecules from foreign cells or viruses. In innate immunity, a small preset group of receptor proteins bind to molecules or structures that are absent from animal bodies but common to a group of viruses, bacteria, or other microbes. Binding of an innate immune receptor to a foreign molecule activates internal defenses, enabling responses to a very broad range of pathogens. A different type of molecular recognition provides the basis for adaptive immunity, a defense found only in vertebrates. Animals with adaptive immunity produce a vast arsenal of receptors, each of which recognizes a feature typically found only on a particular part of a particular molecule in a particular pathogen. As a result, recognition and response in adaptive immunity occur with tremendous specificity. The adaptive immune response, also known as the acquired immune response, is 
activated after the innate immune response and develops more slowly. The names adaptive and acquired reflect the fact that this immune response is enhanced by previous exposure to the infecting pathogen. Examples of adaptive responses include the synthesis of proteins that inactivate a bacterial toxin and the targeted killing of a virus-infected body cell. Figure 43.2 Overview of animal immunity. Immune responses in animals can be divided into innate and adaptive immunity. Some components of innate immunity contribute to activation of adaptive immune defenses.</justification>

        <justification>43.1 In innate immunity, recognition and response rely on traits common to groups of pathogens (pp. 930-935) In both invertebrates and vertebrates, innate immunity is mediated by physical and chemical barriers as well as cell-based defenses. Activation of innate immune responses relies on recognition proteins specific for broad classes of pathogens. In insects, pathogens that penetrate barrier defenses are ingested by cells in the hemolymph that also release antimicrobial peptides. In vertebrates, intact skin and mucous membranes form barriers to pathogens. Mucus produced by membrane cells, the low pH of the skin and stomach, and degradation by lysozyme also deter pathogens. Microbes that penetrate barrier defenses are ingested by phagocytic cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. Additional cellular defenses include natural killer cells, which can induce the death of virus-infected cells. Complement system proteins, interferons, and other antimicrobial peptides also act 
against microbes.</justification>

        <justification>In mammals, epithelial tissues block the entry of many pathogens. These barrier defenses include not only the skin but also the mucous membranes lining the digestive, respiratory, urinary, and reproductive tracts. Certain cells of the mucous membranes produce mucus, a viscous fluid that enhances defenses by trapping microbes and other particles. In the trachea, ciliated epithelial cells sweep mucus and any entrapped microbes upward, helping prevent infection of the lungs. Saliva, tears, and mucous secretions that bathe various exposed epithelia provide a washing action that also inhibits colonization by fungi and bacteria. Beyond their physical role in inhibiting microbial entry, body secretions create an environment that is hostile to many microbes. Lysozyme in tears, saliva, and mucous secretions destroys the cell walls of susceptible bacteria as they enter the openings around the eyes or the upper respiratory tract. Microbes in food or water and those in swallowed mucus must also 
contend with the acidic environment of the stomach, which kills most of them before they can enter the intestines. Similarly, secretions from oil and sweat glands give human skin a pH ranging from 3 to 5, acidic enough to prevent the growth of many bacteria.</justification>

        <justification>Vertebrates are unique in having adaptive immunity in addition to innate immunity. The adaptive response relies on T cells and B cells, which are types of white blood cells called lymphocytes. Like all blood cells, lymphocytes originate from stem cells in the bone marrow. Some lymphocytes migrate from the bone marrow to the thymus, an organ in the thoracic cavity above the heart (see Figure 43.7). These lymphocytes mature into T cells. Lymphocytes that remain and mature in the bone marrow develop as B cells. (Lymphocytes of a third type remain in the blood and become the natural killer cells active in innate immunity. ) Any substance that elicits a response from a B cell or T cell is called an antigen. In adaptive immunity, recognition occurs when a B cell or T cell binds to an antigen, such as a bacterial or viral protein, via a protein called an antigen receptor. An antigen receptor is specific enough to bind to just one part of one molecule from a particular pathogen, such as a 
species of bacteria or strain of virus. Although the cells of the immune system produce millions of different antigen receptors, all of the antigen receptors made by a single B or T cell are identical. Infection by a virus, bacterium, or other pathogen triggers activation of B and T cells with antigen receptors specific for parts of that pathogen. B and T cells are shown here with only a few antigen receptors, but there are actually about 100,000 antigen receptors on the surface of a single B or T cell. Antigens are usually foreign and are typically large molecules, either proteins or polysaccharides. Many antigens protrude from the surface of foreign cells or viruses. Other antigens, such as toxins secreted by bacteria, are released into the extracellular fluid. The small, accessible portion of an antigen that binds to an antigen receptor is called an epitope, or antigenic determinant. An example is a group of amino acids in a particular protein. A single antigen usually has several different epitopes, each 
binding a receptor with a different specificity. Because all antigen receptors produced by a single B cell or T cell are identical, they bind to the same epitope. Each B cell or T cell thus displays specificity for a particular epitope, enabling it to respond to any pathogen that produces molecules containing that same epitope. The antigen receptors of B cells and T cells have similar components, but they encounter antigens in different ways.</justification>

        <justification>43.2 In adaptive immunity, receptors provide pathogen-specific recognition (pp. 935-940) Adaptive immunity relies on lymphocytes that arise from stem cells in the bone marrow and complete their maturation in the bone marrow (B cells) or in the thymus (T cells). Lymphocytes have cell-surface antigen receptors for foreign molecules. All receptor proteins on a single B or T cell are the same, but there are millions of B and T cells in the body that differ in the foreign molecules that their receptors recognize. Upon infection, B and T cells specific for the pathogen are activated. Some T cells help other lymphocytes; others kill infected host cells. B cells called plasma cells produce soluble receptor proteins called antibodies, which bind to foreign molecules and cells. The activated lymphocytes called memory cells defend against future infections by the same pathogen. Recognition of foreign molecules involves the binding of variable regions of receptors to an epitope, a small region of 
an antigen. B cells and antibodies recognize epitopes on the surface of antigens circulating in the blood or lymph. T cells recognize protein epitopes in small antigen fragments (peptides) that are presented on the surface of host cells, complexed with cell-surface proteins called MHC (major histocompatibility complex) molecules. The four major characteristics of B and T cell development are the generation of cell diversity, self-tolerance, proliferation, and immunological memory.</justification>

        <justification>43.3 Adaptive immunity defends against infection of body fluids and body cells (pp. 940-946) Helper T cells interact with antigen fragments displayed by class II MHC molecules on the surface of dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells (antigen-presenting cells). Activated helper T cells secrete cytokines that stimulate other lymphocytes as part of the response to nearly all antigens. Cytotoxic T cells bind to a complex of an antigen fragment and a class I MHC molecule on infected host cells. In the cell-mediated immune response, activated cytotoxic T cells secrete proteins that initiate destruction of infected cells. All T cells have an accessory protein that enhances binding to MHC-antigen fragment complexes. In the humoral immune response, B cell antigen receptors and antibodies bind to extracellular foreign substances in blood and lymph. The binding of antibodies helps eliminate antigens by phagocytosis and complement-mediated lysis. The five major antibody classes differ in 
distribution and function. Active immunity develops in response to infection or to immunization with a nonpathogenic form or part of a pathogen. Active immunity includes a response to and immunological memory for that pathogen.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>In some plant species, alternate modes of carbon fixation have evolved that minimize photorespiration and optimize the Calvin cycle: even in hot, arid climates. The two most important of these photosynthetic adaptations are C4 photosynthesis and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM).</justification>

      </answer>
      <answer>
        <justification>The structure and biochemical functions of the leaves of C4 plants are an evolutionary adaptation to hot, dry climates. This adaptation maintains a CO2 concentration in the bundle sheath that favors photosynthesis over photorespiration. A unique leaf anatomy is correlated with the mechanism of C4 photosynthesis (Figure 10.20; compare with Figure 10.4). In C4 plants, there are two distinct types of photosynthetic cells: bundle-sheath cells and mesophyll cells. Bundle-sheath cells are arranged into tightly packed sheaths around the veins of the leaf. Between the bundle sheath and the leaf surface are the more loosely arranged mesophyll cells. The Calvin cycle is confined to the chloroplasts of the bundle-sheath cells. However, the Calvin cycle is preceded by incorporation of CO2 into organic compounds in the mesophyll cells. See the numbered steps in Figure 10.20, which are also described here: The first step is carried out by an enzyme present only in mesophyll cells called PEP 
carboxylase. This enzyme adds CO2 to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), forming the four-carbon product oxaloacetate. PEP carboxylase has a much higher affinity for CO2 than does rubisco and no affinity for O2. Therefore, PEP carboxylase can fix carbon efficiently when rubisco cannot: that is, when it is hot and dry and stomata are partially closed, causing CO2 concentration in the leaf to fall and O2 concentration to rise. After the C4 plant fixes carbon from CO2, the mesophyll cells export their four-carbon products (malate in the example shown in Figure 10.20) to bundle-sheath cells through plasmodesmata (see Figure 6.31). Within the bundle-sheath cells, the four-carbon compounds release CO2, which is reassimilated into organic material by rubisco and the Calvin cycle. The same reaction regenerates pyruvate, which is transported to mesophyll cells. There, ATP is used to convert pyruvate to PEP, allowing the reaction cycle to continue; this ATP can be thought of as the "price" of concentrating CO2 in the bundle-
sheath cells. To generate this extra ATP, bundle-sheath cells carry out cyclic electron flow, the process described earlier in this chapter (see Figure 10.16). In fact, these cells contain PS I but no PS II, so cyclic electron flow is their only photosynthetic mode of generating ATP. In effect, the mesophyll cells of a C4 plant pump CO2 into the bundle sheath, keeping the CO2 concentration in the bundle-sheath cells high enough for rubisco to bind carbon dioxide rather than oxygen. The cyclic series of reactions involving PEP carboxylase and the regeneration of PEP can be thought of as a CO2-concentrating pump that is powered by ATP. In this way, C4 photosynthesis minimizes photorespiration and enhances sugar production. This adaptation is especially advantageous in hot regions with intense sunlight, where stomata partially close during the day, and it is in such environments that C4 plants evolved and thrive today.</justification>

        <justification>A second photosynthetic adaptation to arid conditions has evolved in many succulent (water-storing) plants, numerous cacti, pineapples, and representatives of several other plant families. These plants open their stomata during the night and close them during the day, just the reverse of how other plants behave. Closing stomata during the day helps desert plants conserve water, but it also prevents CO2 from entering the leaves. During the night, when their stomata are open, these plants take up CO2 and incorporate it into a variety of organic acids. This mode of carbon fixation is called crassulacean acid metabolism, or CAM, after the plant family Crassulaceae, the succulents in which the process was first discovered. The mesophyll cells of CAM plants store the organic acids they make during the night in their vacuoles until morning, when the stomata close. During the day, when the light reactions can supply ATP and NADPH for the Calvin cycle, CO2 is released from the organic acids 
made the night before to become incorporated into sugar in the chloroplasts.</justification>

The C4 and CAM pathways are two evolutionary solutions to the problem of maintaining photosynthesis with stomata partially or completely closed on hot, dry days. Notice in Figure 10.21 that the CAM pathway is similar to the C4 pathway in that carbon dioxide is first incorporated into organic intermediates before it enters the Calvin cycle. The difference is that in C4 plants, the initial steps of carbon fixation are separated structurally from the Calvin cycle, whereas in CAM plants, the two steps occur at separate times but within the same cell.</justification>

        <justification>Recall that the DNA of eukaryotic cells is packaged with proteins in an elaborate complex known as chromatin, the basic unit of which is the nucleosome (see Figure 16.22). The structural organization of chromatin not only packs a cell's DNA into a compact form that fits inside the nucleus, but also helps regulate gene expression in several ways. The location of a gene's promoter relative to nucleosomes and to the sites where the DNA attaches to the chromosome scaffold or nuclear lamina can affect whether the gene is transcribed. In addition, genes within heterochromatin, which is highly condensed, are usually not expressed. Lastly, certain chemical modifications to the histone proteins and to the DNA of chromatin can influence both chromatin structure and gene expression.</justification>

        <justification>In addition to acetylation, histones can undergo several other types of modifications that also help determine the chromatin configuration in a region. There is abundant evidence that chemical modifications to histones, the proteins around which the DNA is wrapped in nucleosomes, play a direct role in the regulation of gene transcription. The N-terminus of each histone molecule in a nucleosome protrudes outward from the nucleosome (Figure 18.7a). These histone tails are accessible to various modifying enzymes that catalyze the addition or removal of specific chemical groups. In histone acetylation, acetyl groups (: COCH3) are attached to lysines in histone tails; deacetylation is the removal of acetyl groups. When the lysines are acetylated, their positive charges are neutralized and the histone tails no longer bind to neighboring nucleosomes (Figure 18.7b). Such binding promotes the folding of chromatin into a more compact structure; when this binding does not occur, chromatin has a 
looser structure. As a result, transcription proteins have easier access to genes in an acetylated region. Researchers have shown that some enzymes that acetylate or deacetylate histones are closely associated with or even components of the transcription factors that bind to promoters (see Figure 17.8). These observations suggest that histone acetylation enzymes may promote the initiation of transcription not only by remodeling chromatin structure, but also by binding to and thus "recruiting" components of the transcription machinery. Other chemical groups, such as methyl and phosphate groups, can be reversibly attached to amino acids in histone tails. Addition of methyl groups (: CH3) to histone tails (histone methylation) can promote condensation of the chromatin, while addition of a phosphate group (phosphorylation) to an amino acid next to a methylated amino acid can have the opposite effect. The recent discovery that modifications to histone tails can affect chromatin structure and gene expression has 
led to the histone code hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that specific combinations of modifications, as well as the order in which they have occurred, help determine the chromatin configuration, which in turn influences transcription.</justification>

        <justification>Although each chromosome has its own territory (see Figure 16.23), loops of chromatin may extend into other sites in the nucleus. Some of these sites are transcription factories that are occupied by multiple chromatin loops from the same chromosome (blue loops) or other chromosomes (red and green loops). You saw in Figure 16.23 that each chromosome in the interphase nucleus occupies a distinct territory. The chromosomes are not completely isolated, however. Recently, techniques have been developed that allow researchers to cross-link and identify regions of chromosomes that associate with each other during interphase. These studies reveal that loops of chromatin extend from individual chromosomal territories into specific sites in the nucleus (Figure 18.12). Different loops from the same chromosome and loops from other chromosomes may congregate in such sites, some of which are rich in RNA polymerases and other transcription-associated proteins. Like a recreation center that draws 
members from many different neighborhoods, these so-called transcription factories are thought to be areas specialized for a common function. The old view that the nuclear contents are like a bowl of amorphous chromosomal spaghetti is giving way to a new model of a nucleus with a defined architecture and regulated movements of chromatin. Relocation of particular genes from their chromosomal territories to transcription factories may be part of the process of readying genes for transcription.</justification>

        <justification>Together, this complex of DNA and protein, called chromatin, fits into the nucleus through an elaborate, multilevel system of packing. Our current view of the successive levels of DNA packing in a chromosome is outlined in Figure 16.22. Study this figure carefully before reading further. Chromatin undergoes striking changes in its degree of packing during the course of the cell cycle (see Figure 12.7). In interphase cells stained for light microscopy, the chromatin usually appears as a diffuse mass within the nucleus, suggesting that the chromatin is highly extended. As a cell prepares for mitosis, its chromatin coils and folds up (condenses), eventually forming a characteristic number of short, thick metaphase chromosomes that are distinguishable from each other with the light microscope. Though interphase chromatin is generally much less condensed than the chromatin of mitotic chromosomes, it shows several of the same levels of higher-order packing. Some of the chromatin comprising a 
chromosome seems to be present as a 10-nm fiber, but much is compacted into a 30-nm fiber, which in some regions is further folded into looped domains. Early on, biologists assumed that interphase chromatin was a tangled mass in the nucleus, like a bowl of spaghetti, but this is far from the case. Although an interphase chromosome lacks an obvious scaffold, its looped domains appear to be attached to the nuclear lamina, on the inside of the nuclear envelope, and perhaps also to fibers of the nuclear matrix. These attachments may help organize regions of chromatin where genes are active. The chromatin of each chromosome occupies a specific restricted area within the interphase nucleus, and the chromatin fibers of different chromosomes do not become entangled (Figure 16.23).</justification>

Histone tails extend outward from each bead-like nucleosome core. Additional coiling and folding leads ultimately to the highly condensed chromatin of the metaphase chromosome. In interphase cells, most chromatin is less compacted (euchromatin), but some remains highly condensed (heterochromatin). Euchromatin, but not heterochromatin, is generally accessible for transcription of genes.</justification>

    <text>How does energy change as electrons move down the electron transport chain?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Electron transfer from NADH to oxygen is an exergonic reaction with a free-energy change of -'53 kcal/mol (-'222 kJ/mol). Instead of this energy being released and wasted in a single explosive step, electrons cascade down the chain from one carrier molecule to the next in a series of redox reactions, losing a small amount of energy with each step until they finally reach oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor, which has a very great affinity for electrons. Each "downhill" carrier is more electronegative than, and thus capable of oxidizing, its "uphill" neighbor, with oxygen at the bottom of the chain. Therefore, the electrons removed from glucose by NAD+ fall down an energy gradient in the electron transport chain to a far more stable location in the electronegative oxygen atom. Put another way, oxygen pulls electrons down the chain in an energy-yielding tumble analogous to gravity pulling objects downhill.</justification>

For example, the nerve gas sarin inhibits acetylcholinesterase, causing a buildup of acetylcholine to levels that trigger paralysis and typically death. In contrast, certain bacteria produce a toxin that inhibits presynaptic release of acetylcholine. This toxin causes a rare but severe form of food poisoning called botulism. Untreated botulism is typically fatal because muscles required for breathing fail to contract when acetylcholine release is blocked. Today, the same botulinum toxin is commonly used in cosmetic procedures.

In asexual reproduction, a single individual is the sole parent and passes copies of all its genes to its offspring without the fusion of gametes. For example, single-celled eukaryotic organisms can reproduce asexually by mitotic cell division, in which DNA is copied and allocated equally to two daughter cells. The genomes of the offspring are virtually exact copies of the parent's genome. Some multicellular organisms are also capable of reproducing asexually (Figure 13.2). Because the cells of the offspring are derived by mitosis in the parent, the "chip off the old block" is usually genetically identical to its parent.

        <justification>The discovery of linked genes and recombination due to crossing over led one of Morgan's students, Alfred H. Sturtevant, to a method for constructing a genetic map, an ordered list of the genetic loci along a particular chromosome. Sturtevant hypothesized that the percentage of recombinant offspring, the recombination frequency, calculated from experiments like the one in Figures 15.9 and 15.10, depends on the distance between genes on a chromosome. He assumed that crossing over is a random event, with the chance of crossing over approximately equal at all points along a chromosome. Based on these assumptions, Sturtevant predicted that the farther apart two genes are, the higher the probability that a crossover will occur between them and therefore the higher the recombination frequency. His reasoning was simple: The greater the distance between two genes, the more points there are between them where crossing over can occur.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 13.11 The results of crossing over during meiosis. As a consequence of the independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis, each of us produces a collection of gametes differing greatly in their combinations of the chromosomes we inherited from our two parents. Figure 13.10 suggests that each chromosome in a gamete is exclusively maternal or paternal in origin. In fact, this is not the case, because crossing over produces recombinant chromosomes, individual chromosomes that carry genes (DNA) derived from two different parents (Figure 13.11). In meiosis in humans, an average of one to three crossover events occur per chromosome pair, depending on the size of the chromosomes and the position of their centromeres. Crossing over begins very early in prophase I as homologous chromosomes pair loosely along their lengths. Each gene on one homolog is aligned precisely with the corresponding gene on the other homolog. In a single crossover event, the DNA of two nonsister chromatids: 
one maternal and one paternal chromatid of a homologous pair: is broken by specific proteins at precisely corresponding points, and the two segments beyond the crossover point are each joined to the other chromatid. Thus, a paternal chromatid is joined to a piece of maternal chromatid beyond the crossover point, and vice versa. In this way, crossing over produces chromosomes with new combinations of maternal and paternal alleles (see Figure 13.11).</justification>

        <justification>Now let's return to Morgan's fly room to see how we can explain the results of the Drosophila testcross illustrated in Figure 15.9. Recall that most of the offspring from the testcross for body color and wing size had parental phenotypes. That suggested that the two genes were on the same chromosome, since the occurrence of parental types with a frequency greater than 50% indicates that the genes are linked. About 17% of offspring, however, were recombinants. Faced with these results, Morgan proposed that some process must occasionally break the physical connection between specific alleles of genes on the same chromosome. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that this process, now called crossing over, accounts for the recombination of linked genes. In crossing over, which occurs while replicated homologous chromosomes are paired during prophase of meiosis I, a set of proteins orchestrates an exchange of corresponding segments of one maternal and one paternal chromatid (see Figure 13.11)

        <justification>To understand the driving forces for gas exchange, we must calculate partial pressure, which is simply the pressure exerted by a particular gas in a mixture of gases. To do so, we need to know the pressure that the mixture exerts and the fraction of the mixture represented by a particular gas. Let's consider O2 as an example. At sea level, the atmosphere exerts a downward force equal to that of a column of mercury (Hg) 760 mm high. Therefore, atmospheric pressure at sea level is 760 mm Hg. Since the atmosphere is 21% O2 by volume, the partial pressure of O2 is 0.21 * 760, or about 160 mm Hg. This value is called the partial pressure of O2 (abbreviated PO2) because it is the part of atmospheric pressure contributed by O2. The partial pressure of CO2 (abbreviated PCO2) is much less, only 0.29 mm Hg at sea level. Partial pressures also apply to gases dissolved in a liquid, such as water. When water is exposed to air, an equilibrium is reached in which the partial pressure of each gas in 
the water equals the partial pressure of that gas in the air. Thus, water exposed to air at sea level has a PO2 of 160 mm Hg, the same as in the atmosphere. However, the concentrations of O2 in the air and water differ substantially because O2 is much less soluble in water than in air. Once we have calculated partial pressures, we can readily predict the net result of diffusion at gas exchange surfaces: A gas always diffuses from a region of higher partial pressure to a region of lower partial pressure.</justification>

        <justification>The conditions for gas exchange vary considerably, depending on whether the respiratory medium: the source of O2: is air or water. As already noted, O2 is plentiful in air, making up about 21% of Earth's atmosphere by volume. Compared to water, air is much less dense and less viscous, so it is easier to move and to force through small passageways. As a result, breathing air is relatively easy and need not be particularly efficient. Humans, for example, extract only about 25% of the O2 in inhaled air.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 42.25 The mammalian respiratory system. From the nasal cavity and pharynx, inhaled air passes through the larynx, trachea, and bronchi to the bronchioles, which end in microscopic alveoli lined by a thin, moist epithelium. Branches of the pulmonary arteries convey oxygen-poor blood to the alveoli; branches of the pulmonary veins transport oxygen-rich blood from the alveoli back to the heart. In mammals, a system of branching ducts conveys air to the lungs, which are located in the thoracic cavity (Figure 42.25). Air enters through the nostrils and is then filtered by hairs, warmed, humidified, and sampled for odors as it flows through a maze of spaces in the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity leads to the pharynx, an intersection where the paths for air and food cross. When food is swallowed, the larynx (the upper part of the respiratory tract) moves upward and tips the epiglottis over the glottis (the opening of the trachea, or windpipe). This allows food to go down the esophagus 
to the stomach (see Figure 41.11). The rest of the time, the glottis is open, enabling breathing. From the larynx, air passes into the trachea. Cartilage reinforcing the walls of both the larynx and the trachea keeps this part of the airway open. Within the larynx of most mammals, exhaled air rushes by a pair of elastic bands of muscle called vocal folds, or, in humans, vocal cords. Sounds are produced when muscles in the larynx are tensed, stretching the cords so they vibrate. High-pitched sounds result from tightly stretched cords vibrating rapidly; low-pitched sounds come from less tense cords vibrating slowly. The trachea branches into two bronchi (singular, bronchus), one leading to each lung. Within the lung, the bronchi branch repeatedly into finer and finer tubes called bronchioles. The entire system of air ducts has the appearance of an inverted tree, the trunk being the trachea. The epithelium lining the major branches of this respiratory tree is covered by cilia and a thin film of mucus. The mucus 
traps dust, pollen, and other particulate contaminants, and the beating cilia move the mucus upward to the pharynx, where it can be swallowed into the esophagus. This process, sometimes referred to as the "mucus escalator," plays a crucial role in cleansing the respiratory system. Gas exchange in mammals occurs in alveoli (singular, alveolus; see Figure 42.25), air sacs clustered at the tips of the tiniest bronchioles. Human lungs contain millions of alveoli, which together have a surface area of about 100 m2, 50 times that of the skin. Oxygen in the air entering the alveoli dissolves in the moist film lining their inner surfaces and rapidly diffuses across the epithelium into a web of capillaries that surrounds each alveolus. Net diffusion of carbon dioxide occurs in the opposite direction, from the capillaries across the epithelium of the alveolus and into the air space. Lacking cilia or significant air currents to remove particles from their surface, alveoli are highly susceptible to contamination.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 42.28 Negative pressure breathing. A mammal breathes by changing the air pressure within its lungs relative to the pressure of the outside atmosphere. Unlike amphibians and birds, mammals employ negative pressure breathing: pulling, rather than pushing, air into their lungs (Figure 42.28). Using muscle contraction to actively expand the thoracic cavity, mammals lower air pressure in their lungs below that of the air outside their body. Because gas flows from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure, air rushes through the nostrils and mouth and down the breathing tubes to the alveoli. During exhalation, the muscles controlling the thoracic cavity relax, and the volume of the cavity is reduced. The increased air pressure in the alveoli forces air up the breathing tubes and out of the body. Thus, inhalation is always active and requires work, whereas exhalation is usually passive. Expanding the thoracic cavity during inhalation involves the animal's rib muscles 
and the diaphragm, a sheet of skeletal muscle that forms the bottom wall of the cavity. Contracting the rib muscles expands the rib cage, the front wall of the thoracic cavity, by pulling the ribs upward and the sternum outward. At the same time, the diaphragm contracts, expanding the thoracic cavity downward. The effect of the descending diaphragm is similar to that of a plunger being drawn out of a syringe. Within the thoracic cavity, a double membrane surrounds the lungs. The inner layer of this membrane adheres to the outside of the lungs, and the outer layer adheres to the wall of the thoracic cavity. A thin space filled with fluid separates the two layers. Surface tension in the fluid causes the two layers to stick together like two plates of glass separated by a film of water: The layers can slide smoothly past each other, but they cannot be pulled apart easily. Consequently, the volume of the thoracic cavity and the volume of the lungs change in unison. Depending on activity level, additional muscles 
may be recruited to aid breathing. The rib muscles and diaphragm are sufficient to change lung volume when a mammal is at rest. During exercise, other muscles of the neck, back, and chest increase the volume of the thoracic cavity by raising the rib cage. In kangaroos and some other species, locomotion causes a rhythmic movement of organs in the abdomen, including the stomach and liver. The result is a piston-like pumping motion that pushes and pulls on the diaphragm, further increasing the volume of air moved in and out of the lungs. The volume of air inhaled and exhaled with each breath is called tidal volume. It averages about 500 mL in resting humans. The tidal volume during maximal inhalation and exhalation is the vital capacity, which is about 3.4 L and 4.8 L for college-age women and men, respectively.</justification>

        <justification>Atoms in a molecule attract shared electrons to varying degrees, depending on the element. The attraction of a particular atom for the electrons of a covalent bond is called its electronegativity. The more electronegative an atom is, the more strongly it pulls shared electrons toward itself. In a covalent bond between two atoms of the same element, the electrons are shared equally because the two atoms have the same electronegativity: the tug-of-war is at a standoff. Such a bond is called a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, the single bond of H2 is nonpolar, as is the double bond of O2. However, when one atom is bonded to a more electronegative atom, the electrons of the bond are not shared equally. This type of bond is called a polar covalent bond. Such bonds vary in their polarity, depending on the relative electronegativity of the two atoms.</justification>

        <justification>A viral infection begins when a virus binds to a host cell and the viral genome makes its way inside (Figure 19.4). The mechanism of genome entry depends on the type of virus and the type of host cell. For example, T-even phages use their elaborate tail apparatus to inject DNA into a bacterium (see Figure 19.3d). Other viruses are taken up by endocytosis or, in the case of enveloped viruses, by fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane. Once the viral genome is inside, the proteins it encodes can commandeer the host, reprogramming the cell to copy the viral nucleic acid and manufacture viral proteins. The host provides the nucleotides for making viral nucleic acids, as well as enzymes, ribosomes, tRNAs, amino acids, ATP, and other components needed for making the viral proteins. Many DNA viruses use the DNA polymerases of the host cell to synthesize new genomes along the templates provided by the viral DNA. In contrast, to replicate their genomes, RNA viruses use virally 
encoded RNA polymerases that can use RNA as a template. (Uninfected cells generally make no enzymes for carrying out this process. ) After the viral nucleic acid molecules and capsomeres are produced, they spontaneously self-assemble into new viruses. In fact, researchers can separate the RNA and capsomeres of TMV and then reassemble complete viruses simply by mixing the components together under the right conditions. The simplest type of viral replicative cycle ends with the exit of hundreds or thousands of viruses from the infected host cell, a process that often damages or destroys the cell. Such cellular damage and death, as well as the body's responses to this destruction, cause many of the symptoms associated with viral infections. The viral progeny that exit a cell have the potential to infect additional cells, spreading the viral infection.</justification>

        <justification>A phage replicative cycle that culminates in death of the host cell is known as a lytic cycle. The term refers to the last stage of infection, during which the bacterium lyses (breaks open) and releases the phages that were produced within the cell. Each of these phages can then infect a healthy cell, and a few successive lytic cycles can destroy an entire bacterial population in just a few hours. A phage that replicates only by a lytic cycle is a virulent phage.</justification>

        <justification>In contrast to the lytic cycle, which kills the host cell, the lysogenic cycle allows replication of the phage genome without destroying the host. Phages capable of using both modes of replicating within a bacterium are called temperate phages. A temperate phage called lambda, written with the Greek letter ', is widely used in biological research. Phage ' resembles T4, but its tail has only one short tail fiber. Figure 19.6 The lytic and lysogenic cycles of phage, a temperate phage. After entering the bacterial cell and circularizing, the ' DNA can immediately initiate the production of a large number of progeny phages (lytic cycle) or integrate into the bacterial chromosome (lysogenic cycle). In most cases, phage ' follows the lytic pathway, which is similar to that detailed in Figure 19.5. However, once a lysogenic cycle begins, the prophage may be carried in the host cell's chromosome for many generations. Phage ' has one main tail fiber, which is short. Infection of an E. coli cell 
by phage ' begins when the phage binds to the surface of the cell and injects its linear DNA genome (Figure 19.6). Within the host, the ' DNA molecule forms a circle. What happens next depends on the replicative mode: lytic cycle or lysogenic cycle. During a lytic cycle, the viral genes immediately turn the host cell into a '-producing factory, and the cell soon lyses and releases its viral products. During a lysogenic cycle, however, the ' DNA molecule is incorporated into a specific site on the E. coli chromosome by viral proteins that break both circular DNA molecules and join them to each other. When integrated into the bacterial chromosome in this way, the viral DNA is known as a prophage. One prophage gene codes for a protein that prevents transcription of most of the other prophage genes. Thus, the phage genome is mostly silent within the bacterium. Every time the E. coli cell prepares to divide, it replicates the phage DNA along with its own and passes the copies on to daughter cells. A single 
infected cell can quickly give rise to a large population of bacteria carrying the virus in prophage form. This mechanism enables viruses to propagate without killing the host cells on which they depend.</justification>

        <justification>An animal virus equipped with an envelope: that is, an outer membrane: uses it to enter the host cell. Protruding from the outer surface of this envelope are viral glycoproteins that bind to specific receptor molecules on the surface of a host cell. Figure 19.7, on the next page, outlines the events in the replicative cycle of an enveloped virus with an RNA genome. Ribosomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the host cell make the protein parts of the envelope glycoproteins; cellular enzymes in the ER and Golgi apparatus then add the sugars. The resulting viral glycoproteins, embedded in host cell-derived membrane, are transported to the cell surface. In a process much like exocytosis, new viral capsids are wrapped in membrane as they bud from the cell. In other words, the viral envelope is derived from the host cell's plasma membrane, although some of the molecules of this membrane are specified by viral genes. The enveloped viruses are now free to infect other cells. This

        <justification>Although some phages and most plant viruses are RNA viruses, the broadest variety of RNA genomes is found among the viruses that infect animals. Among the three types of single-stranded RNA genomes found in animal viruses, the genome of class IV viruses can directly serve as mRNA and thus can be translated into viral protein immediately after infection. Figure 19.7 shows a virus of class V, in which the RNA genome serves as a template for mRNA synthesis. The RNA genome is transcribed into complementary RNA strands, which function both as mRNA and as templates for the synthesis of additional copies of genomic RNA. All viruses that require RNA S RNA synthesis to make mRNA use a viral enzyme capable of carrying out this process; there are no such enzymes in most cells. The viral enzyme is packaged with the genome inside the viral capsid. The RNA animal viruses with the most complicated replicative cycles are the retroviruses (class VI). These viruses are equipped with an enzyme called 
reverse transcriptase, which transcribes an RNA template into DNA, providing an RNA S DNA information flow, the opposite of the usual direction. This unusual phenomenon is the source of the name retroviruses (retro means "backward"). Of particular medical importance is HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), the retrovirus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). HIV and other retroviruses are enveloped viruses that contain two identical molecules of single-stranded RNA and two molecules of reverse transcriptase.

        <justification>Proteins on the surface of a cell are important in the medical field because some proteins can help outside agents invade the cell. For example, cell-surface proteins help the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infect immune system cells, leading to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). (You'll read more about HIV in Chapter 19. ) Learning about the proteins that HIV binds to on immune cells has been central to developing a treatment for HIV infection (Figure 7.11). Figure 7.11 Impact Blocking HIV Entry into Cells as a Treatment for HIV Infections Despite multiple exposures to HIV, a small number of people do not develop AIDS and show no evidence of HIV-infected cells. Comparing their genes with the genes of infected individuals, researchers discovered that resistant individuals have an unusual form of a gene that codes for an immune cell-surface protein called CCR5. Further work showed that HIV binds to a main protein receptor (CD4) on an immune cell, but most types of HIV also 
need to bind to CCR5 as a "co-receptor" to actually infect the cell (below, left). An absence of CCR5 on the cells of resistant individuals, due to the gene alteration, prevents the virus from entering the cells (below, right).</justification>

        <justification>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathogen that causes AIDS, both escapes and attacks the adaptive immune response. Once introduced into the body, HIV infects helper T cells with high efficiency. To infect these cells, the virus binds specifically to the CD4 accessory protein (see Figure 43.16). However, HIV also infects some cell types that have low levels of CD4, such as macrophages and brain cells. In the cell, the HIV RNA genome is reverse-transcribed, and the product DNA is integrated into the host cell's genome (see Figure 19.8). In this form, the viral genome can direct production of new virus particles. Although the body responds to HIV with an immune response sufficient to eliminate most viral infections, some HIV invariably escapes. One reason HIV persists is antigenic variation. The virus mutates at a very high rate during replication. Altered proteins on the surface of some mutated viruses reduce interaction with antibodies and cytotoxic T cells. Such viruses 
survive, proliferate, and mutate further. The virus thus evolves within the body. The continued presence of HIV is also helped by latency. When the viral DNA integrates into the chromosome of a host cell but does not produce new virus proteins or particles, it is shielded from the immune system by the host cell. This inactive, or latent, viral DNA is also protected from antiviral agents currently used against HIV because they attack only actively replicating viruses. Figure 43.25 The progress of an untreated HIV infection. Over time, an untreated HIV infection not only avoids the adaptive immune response but also abolishes it (Figure 43.25). Viral reproduction and cell death triggered by the virus lead to loss of helper T cells, impairing both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The result is a progression to AIDS, characterized by a susceptibility to infections and cancers that a healthy immune system would usually defeat. For example, Pneumocystis carinii, a common fungus that does not cause 
disease in healthy individuals, can result in severe pneumonia in people with AIDS. Likewise, the Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus causes a cancer among AIDS patients that is extremely rare in individuals not infected with HIV. Such opportunistic diseases, as well as nerve damage and body wasting, are the primary causes of death in AIDS patients, not the HIV virus itself. At present, HIV infection cannot be cured, although certain drugs can slow HIV reproduction and the progression to AIDS. Unfortunately, mutations that occur in each round of viral reproduction can generate strains of HIV that are drug resistant. The impact of such viral drug resistance can be reduced by the use of a combination of drugs; viruses newly resistant to one drug can be defeated by another. However, the appearance of strains resistant to multiple drugs reduces the effectiveness of such multidrug "cocktails" in some patients. Frequent mutations in genes for HIV surface antigens also have hampered efforts to develop an effective vaccine.
 Worldwide, the AIDS epidemic continues to grow. In 2008, approximately 2 million people died of AIDS, and the disease is now the leading cause of death in Africa. Transmission of HIV requires the transfer of virus particles or infected cells from person to person via body fluids such as semen, blood, or breast milk. Unprotected sex (that is, without a condom) and transmission via HIV-contaminated needles (typically among intravenous drug users) account for the vast majority of HIV infections. The virus can enter the body through the mucosal linings of the vagina, vulva, penis, or rectum during intercourse or via the mouth during oral sex. The likelihood of transmission is increased by factors that may damage these linings, especially other sexually transmitted infections that cause ulcers or inflammation. People infected with HIV can transmit the disease in the first few weeks of infection, before they express HIV-specific antibodies that can be detected in a blood test (see Figure 43.25). Currently, 10-50% 
of all new HIV infections appear to be caused by recently infected individuals.</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>The electrical insulation that surrounds vertebrate axons is called a myelin sheath (Figure 48.13). Myelin sheaths are produced by two types of glia: oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells in the PNS. During development, these specialized glia wrap axons in many layers of membrane. The membranes forming these layers are mostly lipid, which is a poor conductor of electrical current. Figure 48.14 Saltatory conduction. In a myelinated axon, the depolarizing current during an action potential at one node of Ranvier spreads along the interior of the axon to the next node (blue arrows), where voltage-gated sodium channels enable reinitiation. Thus, the action potential jumps from node to node as it travels along the axon (red arrows). In myelinated axons, voltage-gated sodium channels are restricted to gaps in the myelin sheath called nodes of Ranvier (see Figure 48.13). The extracellular fluid is in contact with the axon membrane only at the nodes. As a result, action potentials are 
not generated in the regions between the nodes. Rather, the inward current produced during the rising phase of the action potential at a node travels all the way to the next node, where it depolarizes the membrane and regenerates the action potential (Figure 48.14). Thus, the time-consuming process of opening and closing of ion channels occurs at only a limited number of positions along the axon. This mechanism for action potential propagation is called saltatory conduction (from the Latin saltare, to leap) because the action potential appears to jump along the axon from node to node. The major selective advantage of myelination is its space efficiency. A myelinated axon 20 microm in diameter has a conduction speed faster than that of a squid giant axon with a diameter 40 times greater. Furthermore, more than 2,000 of those myelinated axons can be packed into the space occupied by just one giant axon.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Enzymes use a variety of mechanisms that lower activation energy and speed up a reaction (see Figure 8.15, step &amp;#10114;). First, in reactions involving two or more reactants, the active site provides a template on which the substrates can come together in the proper orientation for a reaction to occur between them. Second, as the active site of an enzyme clutches the bound substrates, the enzyme may stretch the substrate molecules toward their transition-state form, stressing and bending critical chemical bonds that must be broken during the reaction. Because EA is proportional to the difficulty of breaking the bonds, distorting the substrate helps it approach the transition state and thus reduces the amount of free energy that must be absorbed to achieve that state. Third, the active site may also provide a microenvironment that is more conducive to a particular type of reaction than the solution itself would be without the enzyme. For example, if the active site has amino acids 
with acidic R groups, the active site may be a pocket of low pH in an otherwise neutral cell. In such cases, an acidic amino acid may facilitate H+ transfer to the substrate as a key step in catalyzing the reaction. A fourth mechanism of catalysis is the direct participation of the active site in the chemical reaction. Sometimes this process even involves brief covalent bonding between the substrate and the side chain of an amino acid of the enzyme. Subsequent steps of the reaction restore the side chains to their original states, so that the active site is the same after the reaction as it was before.</justification>

        <justification>Even during interphase, the centromeres and telomeres of chromosomes, as well as other chromosomal regions in some cells, exist in a highly condensed state similar to that seen in a metaphase chromosome. This type of interphase chromatin, visible as irregular clumps with a light microscope, is called heterochromatin, to distinguish it from the less compacted, more dispersed euchromatin ("true chromatin"). Because of its compaction, heterochromatic DNA is largely inaccessible to the machinery in the cell responsible for transcribing the genetic information coded in the DNA, a crucial early step in gene expression. In contrast, the looser packing of euchromatin makes its DNA accessible to this machinery, so the genes present in euchromatin can be transcribed. The chromosome is a dynamic structure that is condensed, loosened, modified, and remodeled as necessary for various cell processes, including mitosis, meiosis, and gene activity. Chemical modifications of histones affect the state 
of chromatin condensation and also have multiple effects on gene activity, as you will see in Chapter 18.</justification>

        <justification>16.3 A chromosome consists of a DNA molecule packed together with proteins (pp. 320-322) The bacterial chromosome is usually a circular DNA molecule with some associated proteins, making up the nucleoid of the cell. Eukaryotic chromatin making up a chromosome is composed of DNA, histones, and other proteins. The histones bind to each other and to the DNA to form nucleosomes, the most basic units of DNA packing. Histone tails extend outward from each bead-like nucleosome core. Additional coiling and folding leads ultimately to the highly condensed chromatin of the metaphase chromosome. In interphase cells, most chromatin is less compacted (euchromatin), but some remains highly condensed (heterochromatin). Euchromatin, but not heterochromatin, is generally accessible for transcription of genes.</justification>

        <justification>Recall that the DNA of eukaryotic cells is packaged with proteins in an elaborate complex known as chromatin, the basic unit of which is the nucleosome (see Figure 16.22). The structural organization of chromatin not only packs a cell's DNA into a compact form that fits inside the nucleus, but also helps regulate gene expression in several ways. The location of a gene's promoter relative to nucleosomes and to the sites where the DNA attaches to the chromosome scaffold or nuclear lamina can affect whether the gene is transcribed. In addition, genes within heterochromatin, which is highly condensed, are usually not expressed. Lastly, certain chemical modifications to the histone proteins and to the DNA of chromatin can influence both chromatin structure and gene expression. Here we examine the effects of these modifications, which are catalyzed by specific enzymes.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 18.7 A simple model of histone tails and the effect of histone acetylation. In addition to acetylation, histones can undergo several other types of modifications that also help determine the chromatin configuration in a region. There is abundant evidence that chemical modifications to histones, the proteins around which the DNA is wrapped in nucleosomes, play a direct role in the regulation of gene transcription. The N-terminus of each histone molecule in a nucleosome protrudes outward from the nucleosome (Figure 18.7a). These histone tails are accessible to various modifying enzymes that catalyze the addition or removal of specific chemical groups. In histone acetylation, acetyl groups (: COCH3) are attached to lysines in histone tails; deacetylation is the removal of acetyl groups. When the lysines are acetylated, their positive charges are neutralized and the histone tails no longer bind to neighboring nucleosomes (Figure 18.7b). Such binding promotes the folding of chromatin 
into a more compact structure; when this binding does not occur, chromatin has a looser structure. As a result, transcription proteins have easier access to genes in an acetylated region. Researchers have shown that some enzymes that acetylate or deacetylate histones are closely associated with or even components of the transcription factors that bind to promoters (see Figure 17.8). These observations suggest that histone acetylation enzymes may promote the initiation of transcription not only by remodeling chromatin structure, but also by binding to and thus "recruiting" components of the transcription machinery. Other chemical groups, such as methyl and phosphate groups, can be reversibly attached to amino acids in histone tails. Addition of methyl groups (: CH3) to histone tails (histone methylation) can promote condensation of the chromatin, while addition of a phosphate group (phosphorylation) to an amino acid next to a methylated amino acid can have the opposite effect. The recent discovery that 
modifications to histone tails can affect chromatin structure and gene expression has led to the histone code hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that specific combinations of modifications, as well as the order in which they have occurred, help determine the chromatin configuration, which in turn influences transcription.</justification>

        <justification>Specific transcription factors that function as repressors can inhibit gene expression in several different ways. Some repressors bind directly to control element DNA (in enhancers or elsewhere), blocking activator binding or, in some cases, turning off transcription even when activators are bound. Other repressors block the binding of activators to proteins that allow the activators to bind to DNA. In addition to influencing transcription directly, some activators and repressors act indirectly by affecting chromatin structure. Studies using yeast and mammalian cells show that some activators recruit proteins that acetylate histones near the promoters of specific genes, thus promoting transcription (see Figure 18.7). Similarly, some repressors recruit proteins that deacetylate histones, leading to reduced transcription, a phenomenon referred to as silencing. Indeed, recruitment of chromatin-modifying proteins seems to be the most common mechanism of repression in eukaryotes.</justification>

        <justification>In addition to affecting mRNAs, small RNAs can cause remodeling of chromatin structure. In some yeasts, siRNAs produced by the yeast cells themselves are required for the formation of heterochromatin at the centromeres of chromosomes. According to one model, an RNA transcript produced from DNA in the centromeric region of the chromosome is copied into double-stranded RNA by a yeast enzyme and then processed into siRNAs. These siRNAs associate with a complex of proteins (different from the one shown in Figure 18.15) and act as a homing device, targeting the complex back to RNA transcripts being made from the centromeric sequences of DNA. Once there, proteins in the complex recruit enzymes that modify the chromatin, turning it into the highly condensed heterochromatin found at the centromere. A newly discovered class of small ncRNAs called piwi-associated RNAs (piRNAs) also induce formation of heterochromatin, blocking expression of some parasitic DNA elements in the genome known as 
transposons. (Transposons are discussed in Chapter 21. ) Usually 24-31 nucleotides in length, piRNAs are probably processed from single-stranded RNA precursors. They play an indispensable role in the germ cells of many animal species, where they appear to help re-establish appropriate methylation patterns in the genome during gamete formation. The cases we have just described involve chromatin remodeling that blocks expression of large regions of the chromosome.</justification>

In this example, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis is used to drive an endergonic process: the cellular synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid and ammonia. For example, with the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to use the energy released by ATP hydrolysis directly to drive chemical reactions that, by themselves, are endergonic. If the deltaG of an endergonic reaction is less than the amount of energy released by ATP hydrolysis, then the two reactions can be coupled so that, overall, the coupled reactions are exergonic (Figure 8.9).</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>In a typical breeding experiment, Mendel cross-pollinated two contrasting, true-breeding pea varieties: for example, purple-flowered plants and white-flowered plants (see Figure 14.2). This mating, or crossing, of two true-breeding varieties is called hybridization. The true-breeding parents are referred to as the P generation (parental generation), and their hybrid offspring are the F1 generation (first filial generation, the word filial from the Latin word for "son"). Allowing these F1 hybrids to self-pollinate (or to cross-pollinate with other F1 hybrids) produces an F2 generation (second filial generation). Mendel usually followed traits for at least the P, F1, and F2 generations. Had Mendel stopped his experiments with the F1 generation, the basic patterns of inheritance would have escaped him. Mendel's quantitative analysis of the F2 plants from thousands of genetic crosses like these allowed him to deduce two fundamental principles of heredity, which have come to be called the 
law of segregation and the law of independent assortment.</justification>

        <justification>If the blending model of inheritance were correct, the F1 hybrids from a cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered pea plants would have pale purple flowers, a trait intermediate between those of the P generation. Notice in Figure 14.2 that the experiment produced a very different result: All the F1 offspring had flowers just as purple as the purple-flowered parents. What happened to the white-flowered plants' genetic contribution to the hybrids? If it were lost, then the F1 plants could produce only purple-flowered offspring in the F2 generation. But when Mendel allowed the F1 plants to self-pollinate and planted their seeds, the white-flower trait reappeared in the F2 generation. Mendel used very large sample sizes and kept accurate records of his results: 705 of the F2 plants had purple flowers, and 224 had white flowers. These data fit a ratio of approximately three purple to one white (Figure 14.3). Mendel reasoned that the heritable factor for white flowers did not 
disappear in the F1 plants, but was somehow hidden, or masked, when the purple-flower factor was present. In Mendel's terminology, purple flower color is a dominant trait, and white flower color is a recessive trait.</justification>

A receptor light chain is encoded by three gene segments: a variable (V) segment, a joining (J) segment, and a constant (C) segment.

The light-chain gene contains a single C segment, 40 different V segments, and 5 different J segments. These alternative copies of the V and J segments are arranged within the gene in a series (Figure 43.13). Because a functional gene is built from one copy of each type of segment, the pieces can be combined in 200 different ways (40 V * 5 J * 1 C).

Photosynthesis reverses the direction of electron flow. Water is split, and electrons are transferred along with hydrogen ions from the water to carbon dioxide, reducing it to sugar.

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>An electron transport chain consists of a number of molecules, mostly proteins, built into the inner membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and the plasma membrane of aerobically respiring prokaryotes. Electrons removed from glucose are shuttled by NADH to the "top," higher-energy end of the chain. At the "bottom," lower-energy end, O2 captures these electrons along with hydrogen nuclei (H+), forming water. Electron transfer from NADH to oxygen is an exergonic reaction with a free-energy change of -'53 kcal/mol (-'222 kJ/mol). Instead of this energy being released and wasted in a single explosive step, electrons cascade down the chain from one carrier molecule to the next in a series of redox reactions, losing a small amount of energy with each step until they finally reach oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor, which has a very great affinity for electrons. Each "downhill" carrier is more electronegative than, and thus capable of oxidizing, its "uphill" neighbor, with 
oxygen at the bottom of the chain. Therefore, the electrons removed from glucose by NAD+ fall down an energy gradient in the electron transport chain to a far more stable location in the electronegative oxygen atom.</justification>

        <justification>Now, putting these different ideas together, you can see that the recombinant chromosomes resulting from crossing over may bring alleles together in new combinations, and the subsequent events of meiosis distribute to gametes the recombinant chromosomes in a multitude of combinations, such as the new variants seen in Figures 15.9 and 15.10. Random fertilization then increases even further the number of variant allele combinations that can be created. This abundance of genetic variation provides the raw material on which natural selection works. If the traits conferred by particular combinations of alleles are better suited for a given environment, organisms possessing those genotypes will be expected to thrive and leave more offspring, ensuring the continuation of their genetic complement. In the next generation, of course, the alleles will be shuffled anew.

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Recall that catabolic pathways release energy by breaking down complex molecules. Biologists say that these complex molecules, such as glucose, are high in chemical energy. During a catabolic reaction, some bonds are broken and others formed, releasing energy and resulting in lower-energy breakdown products. This transformation also occurs, for example, in the engine of a car when the hydrocarbons of gasoline react explosively with oxygen, releasing the energy that pushes the pistons and producing exhaust. Although less explosive, a similar reaction of food molecules with oxygen provides chemical energy in biological systems, producing carbon dioxide and water as waste products. Biochemical pathways, carried out in the context of cellular structures, enable cells to release chemical energy from food molecules and use the energy to power life processes.</justification>

        <justification>At the organismal level as well, complex and beautifully ordered structures result from biological processes that use simpler starting materials (Figure 8.4). However, an organism also takes in organized forms of matter and energy from the surroundings and replaces them with less ordered forms. For example, an animal obtains starch, proteins, and other complex molecules from the food it eats. As catabolic pathways break these molecules down, the animal releases carbon dioxide and water: small molecules that possess less chemical energy than the food did.

A more complicated organic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, is worth mentioning here because its function in the cell is so important. ATP consists of an organic molecule called adenosine attached to a string of three phosphate groups: Where three phosphates are present in series, as in ATP, one phosphate may be split off as a result of a reaction with water. This inorganic phosphate ion, HOPO32-', is often abbreviated Pi in this book. Having lost one phosphate, ATP becomes adenosine diphosphate, or ADP. Although ATP is sometimes said to store energy, it is more accurate to think of it as storing the potential to react with water.

        <justification>To pump a solute across a membrane against its gradient requires work; the cell must expend energy. Therefore, this type of membrane traffic is called active transport. The transport proteins that move solutes against their concentration gradients are all carrier proteins rather than channel proteins. This makes sense because when channel proteins are open, they merely allow solutes to diffuse down their concentration gradients rather than picking them up and transporting them against their gradients. Figure 7.18 The sodium-potassium pump: a specific case of active transport. This transport system pumps ions against steep concentration gradients: Sodium ion concentration ([Na+]) is high outside the cell and low inside, while potassium ion concentration ([K+]) is low outside the cell and high inside. The pump oscillates between two shapes in a cycle that moves 3 Na+ out of the cell for every 2 K+ pumped into the cell. The two shapes have different affinities for Na+ and K+. ATP powers 
the shape change by transferring a phosphate group to the transport protein (phosphorylating the protein). Active transport enables a cell to maintain internal concentrations of small solutes that differ from concentrations in its environment. For example, compared with its surroundings, an animal cell has a much higher concentration of potassium ions (K+) and a much lower concentration of sodium ions (Na+). The plasma membrane helps maintain these steep gradients by pumping Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell. Figure 7.19 Review: passive and active transport. As in other types of cellular work, ATP supplies the energy for most active transport. One way ATP can power active transport is by transferring its terminal phosphate group directly to the transport protein. This can induce the protein to change its shape in a manner that translocates a solute bound to the protein across the membrane. One transport system that works this way is the sodium-potassium pump, which exchanges Na+ for K+ across the 
plasma membrane of animal cells (Figure 7.18). The distinction between passive transport and active transport is reviewed in Figure 7.19.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 7.21 Cotransport: active transport driven by a concentration gradient. A carrier protein, such as this sucrose-H+ cotransporter in a plant cell, is able to use the diffusion of H+ down its electrochemical gradient into the cell to drive the uptake of sucrose. The H+ gradient is maintained by an ATP-driven proton pump that concentrates H+ outside the cell, thus storing potential energy that can be used for active transport, in this case of sucrose. Thus, ATP indirectly provides the energy necessary for cotransport. (The cell wall is not shown. ) A single ATP-powered pump that transports a specific solute can indirectly drive the active transport of several other solutes in a mechanism called cotransport. A substance that has been pumped across a membrane can do work as it moves back across the membrane by diffusion, analogous to water that has been pumped uphill and performs work as it flows back down. Another transport protein, a cotransporter separate from the pump, can couple 
the "downhill" diffusion of this substance to the "uphill" transport of a second substance against its own concentration (or electrochemical) gradient. For example, a plant cell uses the gradient of H+ generated by its proton pumps to drive the active transport of amino acids, sugars, and several other nutrients into the cell. One transport protein couples the return of H+ to the transport of sucrose into the cell (Figure 7.21). This protein can translocate sucrose into the cell against a concentration gradient, but only if the sucrose molecule travels in the company of a hydrogen ion. The hydrogen ion uses the transport protein as an avenue to diffuse down the electrochemical gradient maintained by the proton pump. Plants use sucrose-H+ cotransport to load sucrose produced by photosynthesis into cells in the veins of leaves. The vascular tissue of the plant can then distribute the sugar to nonphotosynthetic organs, such as roots.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 8.8 The structure and hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP (adenosine triphosphate) was introduced in Chapter 4 when we discussed the phosphate group as a functional group. ATP contains the sugar ribose, with the nitrogenous base adenine and a chain of three phosphate groups bonded to it (Figure 8.8a). In addition to its role in energy coupling, ATP is also one of the nucleoside triphosphates used to make RNA (see Figure 5.26). The bonds between the phosphate groups of ATP can be broken by hydrolysis. When the terminal phosphate bond is broken by addition of a water molecule, a molecule of inorganic phosphate (HOPO32-, abbreviated &amp;#9413;i throughout this book) leaves the ATP, which becomes adenosine diphosphate, or ADP (Figure 8.8b). The reaction is exergonic and releases 7.3 kcal of energy per mole of ATP hydrolyzed: ATP + H2O &amp;rarr; ADP + &amp;#9413;i &amp;Delta;G = -'7.3 kcal/mol (-'30.5 kJ/mol) This is the free-energy change measured under standard 
conditions. In the cell, conditions do not conform to standard conditions, primarily because reactant and product concentrations differ from 1 M. For example, when ATP hydrolysis occurs under cellular conditions, the actual deltaG is about -'13 kcal/mol, 78% greater than the energy released by ATP hydrolysis under standard conditions. Because their hydrolysis releases energy, the phosphate bonds of ATP are sometimes referred to as high-energy phosphate bonds, but the term is misleading. The phosphate bonds of ATP are not unusually strong bonds, as "high-energy" may imply; rather, the reactants (ATP and water) themselves have high energy relative to the energy of the products (ADP and &amp;#9413;i). The release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change to a state of lower free energy, not from the phosphate bonds themselves. ATP is useful to the cell because the energy it releases on losing a phosphate group is somewhat greater than the energy most other molecules could deliver. 
But why does this hydrolysis release so much energy? If we reexamine the ATP molecule in Figure 8.8a, we can see that all three phosphate groups are negatively charged. These like charges are crowded together, and their mutual repulsion contributes to the instability of this region of the ATP molecule. The triphosphate tail of ATP is the chemical equivalent of a compressed spring.</justification>

        <justification>When ATP is hydrolyzed in a test tube, the release of free energy merely heats the surrounding water. In an organism, this same generation of heat can sometimes be beneficial. For instance, the process of shivering uses ATP hydrolysis during muscle contraction to generate heat and warm the body. In most cases in the cell, however, the generation of heat alone would be an inefficient (and potentially dangerous) use of a valuable energy resource. Instead, the cell's proteins harness the energy released during ATP hydrolysis in several ways to perform the three types of cellular work: chemical, transport, and mechanical. Figure 8.9 How ATP drives chemical work: Energy coupling using ATP hydrolysis. In this example, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis is used to drive an endergonic process: the cellular synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid and ammonia. For example, with the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to use the energy released by ATP hydrolysis 
directly to drive chemical reactions that, by themselves, are endergonic. If the deltaG of an endergonic reaction is less than the amount of energy released by ATP hydrolysis, then the two reactions can be coupled so that, overall, the coupled reactions are exergonic (Figure 8.9). This usually involves the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to some other molecule, such as the reactant. The recipient with the phosphate group covalently bonded to it is then called a phosphorylated intermediate. The key to coupling exergonic and endergonic reactions is the formation of this phosphorylated intermediate, which is more reactive (less stable) than the original unphosphorylated molecule. Figure 8.10 How ATP drives transport and mechanical work. ATP hydrolysis causes changes in the shapes and binding affinities of proteins. This can occur either (a) directly, by phosphorylation, as shown for a membrane protein carrying out active transport of a solute (see also Figure 7.18), or (b) indirectly, via noncovalent 
binding of ATP and its hydrolytic products, as is the case for motor proteins that move vesicles (and other organelles) along cytoskeletal "tracks" in the cell (see also Figure 6.21). Transport and mechanical work in the cell are also nearly always powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. In these cases, ATP hydrolysis leads to a change in a protein's shape and often its ability to bind another molecule. Sometimes this occurs via a phosphorylated intermediate, as seen for the transport protein in Figure 8.10a. In most instances of mechanical work involving motor proteins "walking" along cytoskeletal elements (Figure 8.10b), a cycle occurs in which ATP is first bound noncovalently to the motor protein. Next, ATP is hydrolyzed, releasing ADP and &amp;#9413;i. Another ATP molecule can then bind. At each stage, the motor protein changes its shape and ability to bind the cytoskeleton, resulting in movement of the protein along the cytoskeletal track.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 8.11 The ATP cycle. Energy released by breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell is used to phosphorylate ADP, regenerating ATP. Chemical potential energy stored in ATP drives most cellular work. An organism at work uses ATP continuously, but ATP is a renewable resource that can be regenerated by the addition of phosphate to ADP (Figure 8.11). The free energy required to phosphorylate ADP comes from exergonic breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell. This shuttling of inorganic phosphate and energy is called the ATP cycle, and it couples the cell's energy-yielding (exergonic) processes to the energy-consuming (endergonic) ones. The ATP cycle proceeds at an astonishing pace. For example, a working muscle cell recycles its entire pool of ATP in less than a minute. That turnover represents 10 million molecules of ATP consumed and regenerated per second per cell. If ATP could not be regenerated by the phosphorylation of ADP, humans would use up nearly their body weight in ATP 
each day. Because both directions of a reversible process cannot be downhill, the regeneration of ATP from ADP and &amp;#9413;i is necessarily endergonic: ADP + &amp;#9413;i &amp;rarr; ATP + H2O &amp;Delta;G = +7.3 kcal/mol (+30.5 kJ/mol) (standard conditions) Since ATP formation from ADP and &amp;#9413;i is not spontaneous, free energy must be spent to make it occur. Catabolic (exergonic) pathways, especially cellular respiration, provide the energy for the endergonic process of making ATP. Plants also use light energy to produce ATP. Thus, the ATP cycle is a revolving door through which energy passes during its transfer from catabolic to anabolic pathways.</justification>

        <justification>Within the bundle-sheath cells, the four-carbon compounds release CO2, which is reassimilated into organic material by rubisco and the Calvin cycle. The same reaction regenerates pyruvate, which is transported to mesophyll cells. There, ATP is used to convert pyruvate to PEP, allowing the reaction cycle to continue; this ATP can be thought of as the "price" of concentrating CO2 in the bundle-sheath cells. To generate this extra ATP, bundle-sheath cells carry out cyclic electron flow, the process described earlier in this chapter (see Figure 10.16). In fact, these cells contain PS I but no PS II, so cyclic electron flow is their only photosynthetic mode of generating ATP. In effect, the mesophyll cells of a C4 plant pump CO2 into the bundle sheath, keeping the CO2 concentration in the bundle-sheath cells high enough for rubisco to bind carbon dioxide rather than oxygen. The cyclic series of reactions involving PEP carboxylase and the regeneration of PEP can be thought of as a CO2-
concentrating pump that is powered by ATP. In this way, C4 photosynthesis minimizes photorespiration and enhances sugar production. This adaptation is especially advantageous in hot regions with intense sunlight, where stomata partially close during the day, and it is in such environments that C4 plants evolved and thrive today.</justification>

Linkage of the tRNA and amino acid is an endergonic process that occurs at the expense of ATP. The ATP loses two phosphate groups, becoming AMP (adenosine monophosphate). The accurate translation of a genetic message requires two instances of molecular recognition. First, a tRNA that binds to an mRNA codon specifying a particular amino acid must carry that amino acid, and no other, to the ribosome. The correct matching up of tRNA and amino acid is carried out by a family of related enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Figure 17.16). The active site of each type of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase fits only a specific combination of amino acid and tRNA. (Regions of both the amino acid attachment end and the anticodon end of the tRNA are instrumental in ensuring the specific fit. ) There are 20 different synthetases, one for each amino acid; each synthetase is able to bind all the different tRNAs that code 
for its particular amino acid. The synthetase catalyzes the covalent attachment of the amino acid to its tRNA in a process driven by the hydrolysis of ATP. The resulting aminoacyl tRNA, also called a charged tRNA, is released from the enzyme and is then available to deliver its amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain on a ribosome.</justification>

One of the more important bacteria involved in N2 fixation is the genus Rhizobium, which forms intimate associations with the roots of legumes (such as peas, soybeans, alfalfa, and peanuts) and markedly alters their root structure. Although Rhizobium can be free-living in the soil, it cannot fix N2 in its free state, nor can legume roots fix N2 without the bacteria. The conversion of N2 to NH3 is a complicated, multistep process, but the reactants and products in nitrogen fixation can be summarized as follows: N2 + 8 e-' + 8 H+ + 16 ATP S 2 NH3 + H2 + 16 ADP + 16 Pi The enzyme complex nitrogenase catalyzes the entire reaction sequence, which reduces N2 to NH3 by adding electrons and H+. Because the process of nitrogen fixation requires eight ATP molecules for each NH3 
synthesized, nitrogen-fixing bacteria require a rich supply of carbohydrates from decaying material, root secretions, or (in the case of Rhizobium) the vascular tissue of roots.</justification>

        <justification>Potassium ions (K+) and sodium ions (Na+) play an essential role in the formation of the resting potential. Each type of ion has a concentration gradient across the plasma membrane of a neuron (Table 48.1). In the case of mammalian neurons, the concentration of K+ is highest inside the cell, while the concentration of Na+ is highest outside. These Na+ and K+ gradients are maintained by sodium-potassium pumps in the plasma membrane. As discussed in Chapter 7, these ion pumps use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to actively transport Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell (Figure 48.7). There are also concentration gradients for chloride ions (Cl-') and other anions, as shown in Table 48.1, but we will ignore these for the moment. Table 48.1 Ion Concentrations Inside and Outside of Mammalian Neurons Ion Intracellular Concentration (mM) Extracellular Concentration (mM) Potassium (K+) 140 5 Sodium (Na+) 15 150 Chloride (Cl-') 10 120 Large anions (A-') inside cell, such as proteins 100 (not 
applicable) Figure 48.7 The basis of the membrane potential. The sodium-potassium pump generates and maintains the ionic gradients of Na+ and K+ shown in Table 48.1. The pump uses ATP to actively transport Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell. Although there is a substantial concentration gradient of sodium across the membrane, very little net diffusion of Na+ occurs because there are very few open sodium channels. In contrast, the large number of open potassium channels allow a significant net outflow of K+. Because the membrane is only weakly permeable to chloride and other anions, this outflow of K+ results in a net negative charge inside the cell.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Some transport proteins, called channel proteins, function by having a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or atomic ions use as a tunnel through the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, left). For example, the passage of water molecules through the membrane in certain cells is greatly facilitated by channel proteins known as aquaporins. Each aquaporin allows entry of up to 3 billion (3 * 109) water molecules per second, passing single file through its central channel, which fits ten at a time. Without aquaporins, only a tiny fraction of these water molecules would pass through the same area of the cell membrane in a second, so the channel protein brings about a tremendous increase in rate.</justification>

        <justification>As described earlier, the two types of transport proteins are channel proteins and carrier proteins. Channel proteins simply provide corridors that allow specific molecules or ions to cross the membrane (Figure 7.17a). The hydrophilic passageways provided by these proteins can allow water molecules or small ions to diffuse very quickly from one side of the membrane to the other. Aquaporins, the water channel proteins, facilitate the massive amounts of diffusion that occur in plant cells and in animal cells such as red blood cells (see Figure 7.15). Certain kidney cells also have a high number of aquaporins, allowing them to reclaim water from urine before it is excreted.

        <justification>A difference in water potential determines the direction of water movement across membranes, but how do water molecules actually cross the membranes? Water molecules are small enough to diffuse across the phospholipid bilayer, even though the bilayer's interior is hydrophobic. However, their movement across biological membranes is too rapid to be explained by unaided diffusion. The transport of water molecules across membranes is facilitated by transport proteins called aquaporins (see Chapter 7). These selective channels affect the rate at which water moves osmotically across the membrane. Aquaporin channel proteins are highly dynamic: Their permeability is decreased by increases in cytosolic Ca2+ or decreases in cytosolic pH.</justification>

On the cellular level, our muscle cells behave as facultative anaerobes. In such cells, pyruvate is a fork in the metabolic road that leads to two alternative catabolic routes (Figure 9.18). Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate can be converted to acetyl CoA, and oxidation continues in the citric acid cycle via aerobic respiration. Under anaerobic conditions, lactic acid fermentation occurs: Pyruvate is diverted from the citric acid cycle, serving instead as an electron acceptor to recycle NAD+. To make the same amount of ATP, a facultative anaerobe has to consume sugar at a much faster rate when fermenting than when respiring.</justification>

        <justification>Certain chemicals selectively inhibit the action of specific enzymes, and we have learned a lot about enzyme function by studying the effects of these molecules. If the inhibitor attaches to the enzyme by covalent bonds, inhibition is usually irreversible. Figure 8.17 Inhibition of enzyme activity. Many enzyme inhibitors, however, bind to the enzyme by weak interactions, in which case inhibition is reversible. Some reversible inhibitors resemble the normal substrate molecule and compete for admission into the active site (Figure 8.17a and b). These mimics, called competitive inhibitors, reduce the productivity of enzymes by blocking substrates from entering active sites. This kind of inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentration of substrate so that as active sites become available, more substrate molecules than inhibitor molecules are around to gain entry to the sites. In contrast, noncompetitive inhibitors do not directly compete with the substrate to bind to the enzyme 
at the active site (Figure 8.17c). Instead, they impede enzymatic reactions by binding to another part of the enzyme. This interaction causes the enzyme molecule to change its shape in such a way that the active site becomes less effective at catalyzing the conversion of substrate to product. Toxins and poisons are often irreversible enzyme inhibitors. An example is sarin, a nerve gas that caused the death of several people and injury to many others when it was released by terrorists in the Tokyo subway in 1995. This small molecule binds covalently to the R group on the amino acid serine, which is found in the active site of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme important in the nervous system. Other examples include the pesticides DDT and parathion, inhibitors of key enzymes in the nervous system. Finally, many antibiotics are inhibitors of specific enzymes in bacteria. For instance, penicillin blocks the active site of an enzyme that many bacteria use to make their cell walls. Citing enzyme inhibitors that are 
metabolic poisons may give the impression that enzyme inhibition is generally abnormal and harmful. In fact, molecules naturally present in the cell often regulate enzyme activity by acting as inhibitors. Such regulation: selective inhibition: is essential to the control of cellular metabolism, as we will discuss in Concept 8.5.</justification>

The entire complex oscillates between two different shapes, one catalytically active and the other inactive (Figure 8.19a). In the simplest kind of allosteric regulation, an activating or inhibiting regulatory molecule binds to a regulatory site (sometimes called an allosteric site), often located where subunits join. The binding of an activator to a regulatory site stabilizes the shape that has functional active sites, whereas the binding of an inhibitor stabilizes the inactive form of the enzyme. The subunits of an allosteric enzyme fit together in such a way that a shape change in one subunit is transmitted to all others.

        <justification>Are there allosteric inhibitors of caspase enzymes? Experiment In an effort to identify allosteric inhibitors of caspases, Justin Scheer and co-workers screened close to 8,000 compounds for their ability to bind to a possible allosteric binding site in caspase 1 and inhibit the enzyme's activity. Each compound was designed to form a disulfide bond with a cysteine near the site in order to stabilize the low-affinity interaction that is expected of an allosteric inhibitor. As the caspases are known to exist in both active and inactive forms, the researchers hypothesized that this linkage might lock the enzyme in the inactive form. To test this model, X-ray diffraction analysis was used to determine the structure of caspase 1 when bound to one of the inhibitors and to compare it with the active and inactive structures. Results Fourteen compounds were identified that could bind to the proposed allosteric site (red) of caspase 1 and block enzymatic activity. The enzyme's shape when one such 
inhibitor was bound resembled the inactive caspase 1 more than the active form. Conclusion That particular inhibitory compound apparently locks the enzyme in its inactive form, as expected for a true allosteric regulator. The data therefore support the existence of an allosteric inhibitory site on caspase 1 that can be used to control enzymatic activity. SOURCE J. M. Scheer et al. , A common allosteric site and mechanism in caspases, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 103: 7595-7600 (2006).

When ATP allosterically inhibits an enzyme in an ATP-generating pathway, as we discussed earlier, the result is feedback inhibition, a common mode of metabolic control. In feedback inhibition, a metabolic pathway is switched off by the inhibitory binding of its end product to an enzyme that acts early in the pathway. Figure 8.21 shows an example of this control mechanism operating on an anabolic pathway. Certain cells use this five-step pathway to synthesize the amino acid isoleucine from threonine, another amino acid. As isoleucine accumulates, it slows down its own synthesis by allosterically inhibiting the enzyme for the first step of the pathway. Feedback inhibition thereby prevents the cell from wasting chemical resources by making more isoleucine than is necessary.</justification>

The orientation diagram on the left relates glycolysis to the entire process of respiration. Note that glycolysis is a source of ATP and NADH. Figure 9.8 The energy input and output of glycolysis. As summarized in Figure 9.8, glycolysis can be divided into two phases: energy investment and energy payoff. During the energy investment phase, the cell actually spends ATP. This investment is repaid with interest during the energy payoff phase, when ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation and NAD+ is reduced to NADH by electrons released from the oxidation of glucose. The net energy yield from glycolysis, per glucose 
molecule, is 2 ATP plus 2 NADH. The ten steps of the glycolytic pathway are shown in Figure 9.9. All of the carbon originally present in glucose is accounted for in the two molecules of pyruvate; no carbon is released as CO2 during glycolysis. Glycolysis occurs whether or not O2 is present.

The NAD+ can then be reused to oxidize sugar by glycolysis, which nets two molecules of ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. There are many types of fermentation, differing in the end products formed from pyruvate. Two common types are alcohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation. Figure 9.17 Fermentation. In the absence of oxygen, many cells use fermentation to produce ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. Pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, serves as an electron acceptor for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which can then be reused in glycolysis. Two of the common end products formed from fermentation are (a) ethanol and (b) lactate, the ionized form of lactic acid. In alcohol fermentation (Figure 9.17a), pyruvate is converted to ethanol (ethyl alcohol) in two steps. The first step releases carbon dioxide from the pyruvate, 
which is converted to the two-carbon compound acetaldehyde. In the second step, acetaldehyde is reduced by NADH to ethanol. This regenerates the supply of NAD+ needed for the continuation of glycolysis. Many bacteria carry out alcohol fermentation under anaerobic conditions. Yeast (a fungus) also carries out alcohol fermentation. For thousands of years, humans have used yeast in brewing, winemaking, and baking. The CO2 bubbles generated by baker's yeast during alcohol fermentation allow bread to rise. During lactic acid fermentation (Figure 9.17b), pyruvate is reduced directly by NADH to form lactate as an end product, with no release of CO2. (Lactate is the ionized form of lactic acid. ) Lactic acid fermentation by certain fungi and bacteria is used in the dairy industry to make cheese and yogurt. Human muscle cells make ATP by lactic acid fermentation when oxygen is scarce. This occurs during the early stages of strenuous exercise, when sugar catabolism for ATP production outpaces the muscle's supply of 
oxygen from the blood. Under these conditions, the cells switch from aerobic respiration to fermentation. The lactate that accumulates was previously thought to cause muscle fatigue and pain, but recent research suggests instead that increased levels of potassium ions (K+) may be to blame, while lactate appears to enhance muscle performance. In any case, the excess lactate is gradually carried away by the blood to the liver, where it is converted back to pyruvate by liver cells. Because oxygen is available, this pyruvate can then enter the mitochondria in liver cells and complete cellular respiration.</justification>

        <justification>Fermentation, anaerobic respiration, and aerobic respiration are three alternative cellular pathways for producing ATP by harvesting the chemical energy of food. All three use glycolysis to oxidize glucose and other organic fuels to pyruvate, with a net production of 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. And in all three pathways, NAD+ is the oxidizing agent that accepts electrons from food during glycolysis. A key difference among the three pathways is the contrasting mechanisms for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which is required to sustain glycolysis. In fermentation, the final electron acceptor is an organic molecule such as pyruvate (lactic acid fermentation) or acetaldehyde (alcohol fermentation).</justification>

        <justification>Without an electron transport chain, the energy still stored in pyruvate is unavailable to most cells. Thus, cellular respiration harvests much more energy from each sugar molecule than fermentation can. In fact, aerobic respiration yields up to 16 times as much ATP per glucose molecule as does fermentation: up to 32 molecules of ATP for respiration, compared with 2 molecules of ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation in fermentation.</justification>

        <justification>9.5 Fermentation and anaerobic respiration enable cells to produce ATP without the use of oxygen (pp. 177-179) Glycolysis nets 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation, whether oxygen is present or not. Under anaerobic conditions, either anaerobic respiration or fermentation can take place. In anaerobic respiration, an electron transport chain is present with a final electron acceptor other than oxygen. In fermentation, the electrons from NADH are passed to pyruvate or a derivative of pyruvate, regenerating the NAD+ required to oxidize more glucose. Two common types of fermentation are alcohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation. Fermentation and anaerobic or aerobic respiration all use glycolysis to oxidize glucose, but they differ in their final electron acceptor and whether an electron transport chain is used (respiration) or not (fermentation). Respiration yields more ATP; aerobic respiration, with O2 as the final electron acceptor, yields about 16 times as much ATP as does 
fermentation.</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Metabolism as a whole manages the material and energy resources of the cell. Some metabolic pathways release energy by breaking down complex molecules to simpler compounds. These degradative processes are called catabolic pathways, or breakdown pathways. A major pathway of catabolism is cellular respiration, in which the sugar glucose and other organic fuels are broken down in the presence of oxygen to carbon dioxide and water. (Pathways can have more than one starting molecule and/or product. ) Energy that was stored in the organic molecules becomes available to do the work of the cell, such as ciliary beating or membrane transport. Anabolic pathways, in contrast, consume energy to build complicated molecules from simpler ones; they are sometimes called biosynthetic pathways. Examples of anabolism are the synthesis of an amino acid from simpler molecules and the synthesis of a protein from amino acids. Catabolic and anabolic pathways are the "downhill" and "uphill" avenues of the 
metabolic landscape. Energy released from the downhill reactions of catabolic pathways can be stored and then used to drive the uphill reactions of anabolic pathways.</justification>

        <justification>Recall that catabolic pathways release energy by breaking down complex molecules. Biologists say that these complex molecules, such as glucose, are high in chemical energy. During a catabolic reaction, some bonds are broken and others formed, releasing energy and resulting in lower-energy breakdown products. This transformation also occurs, for example, in the engine of a car when the hydrocarbons of gasoline react explosively with oxygen, releasing the energy that pushes the pistons and producing exhaust. Although less explosive, a similar reaction of food molecules with oxygen provides chemical energy in biological systems, producing carbon dioxide and water as waste products. Biochemical pathways, carried out in the context of cellular structures, enable cells to release chemical energy from food molecules and use the energy to power life processes.</justification>

        <justification>Recall from Chapter 5 that the three-dimensional structures of proteins are sensitive to their environment. As a consequence, each enzyme works better under some conditions than under other conditions, because these optimal conditions favor the most active shape for the enzyme molecule. Figure 8.16 Environmental factors affecting enzyme activity. Each enzyme has an optimal (a) temperature and (b) pH that favor the most active shape of the protein molecule. Temperature and pH are environmental factors important in the activity of an enzyme. Up to a point, the rate of an enzymatic reaction increases with increasing temperature, partly because substrates collide with active sites more frequently when the molecules move rapidly. Above that temperature, however, the speed of the enzymatic reaction drops sharply. The thermal agitation of the enzyme molecule disrupts the hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and other weak interactions that stabilize the active shape of the enzyme, and the protein 
molecule eventually denatures. Each enzyme has an optimal temperature at which its reaction rate is greatest. Without denaturing the enzyme, this temperature allows the greatest number of molecular collisions and the fastest conversion of the reactants to product molecules. Most human enzymes have optimal temperatures of about 35-40 degree C (close to human body temperature). The thermophilic bacteria that live in hot springs contain enzymes with optimal temperatures of 70 degree C or higher (Figure 8.16a on the next page).</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Now let's take a closer look at the electron transport chain in Figure 9.13. We'll first describe the passage of electrons through complex I in some detail, as an illustration of the general principles involved in electron transport. Electrons removed from glucose by NAD+, during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, are transferred from NADH to the first molecule of the electron transport chain in complex I. This molecule is a flavoprotein, so named because it has a prosthetic group called flavin mononucleotide (FMN). In the next redox reaction, the flavoprotein returns to its oxidized form as it passes electrons to an iron-sulfur protein (Fe. S in complex I), one of a family of proteins with both iron and sulfur tightly bound. The iron-sulfur protein then passes the electrons to a compound called ubiquinone (Q in Figure 9.13). This electron carrier is a small hydrophobic molecule, the only member of the electron transport chain that is not a protein. Ubiquinone is individually mobile 
within the membrane rather than residing in a particular complex. (Another name for ubiquinone is coenzyme Q, or CoQ; you may have seen it sold as a nutritional supplement. ) Most of the remaining electron carriers between ubiquinone and oxygen are proteins called cytochromes. Their prosthetic group, called a heme group, has an iron atom that accepts and donates electrons. (It is similar to the heme group in hemoglobin, the protein of red blood cells, except that the iron in hemoglobin carries oxygen, not electrons. ) The electron transport chain has several types of cytochromes, each a different protein with a slightly different electron-carrying heme group. The last cytochrome of the chain, cyt a3, passes its electrons to oxygen, which is very electronegative. Each oxygen atom also picks up a pair of hydrogen ions from the aqueous solution, forming water.</justification>

        <justification>From studying the structure of ATP synthase, scientists have learned how the flow of H+ through this large enzyme powers ATP generation. ATP synthase is a multisubunit complex with four main parts, each made up of multiple polypeptides. Protons move one by one into binding sites on one of the parts (the rotor), causing it to spin in a way that catalyzes ATP production from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Figure 9.14). The flow of protons thus behaves somewhat like a rushing stream that turns a waterwheel. ATP synthase is the smallest molecular rotary motor known in nature. Figure 9.15 Chemiosmosis couples the electron transport chain to ATP synthesis. &amp;#x278A; NADH and FADH2 shuttle high-energy electrons extracted from food during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle into an electron transport chain built into the inner mitochondrial membrane. The gold arrows trace the transport of electrons, which finally pass to oxygen at the "downhill" end of the chain, forming water. As Figure 9.
13 showed, most of the electron carriers of the chain are grouped into four complexes. Two mobile carriers, ubiquinone (Q) and cytochrome c (Cyt c), move rapidly, ferrying electrons between the large complexes. As complexes I, III, and IV accept and then donate electrons, they pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. (In prokaryotes, protons are pumped outside the plasma membrane. ) Note that FADH2 deposits its electrons via complex II and so results in fewer protons being pumped into the intermembrane space than occurs with NADH. Chemical energy originally harvested from food is transformed into a proton-motive force, a gradient of H+ across the membrane. &amp;#x278B; During chemiosmosis, the protons flow back down their gradient via ATP synthase, which is built into the membrane nearby. The ATP synthase harnesses the proton-motive force to phosphorylate ADP, forming ATP.</justification>

The pathway that is used depends on the type of cell and on the particular signal that initiates apoptosis. One major pathway involves certain mitochondrial proteins that are triggered to form molecular pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane, causing it to leak and release other proteins that promote apoptosis. Surprisingly, these latter include cytochrome c, which functions in mitochondrial electron transport in healthy cells (see Figure 9.15) but acts as a cell death factor when released from mitochondria. The process of mitochondrial apoptosis in mammals uses proteins similar to the nematode proteins Ced-3, Ced-4, and Ced-9.

If a depolarization opens voltage-gated sodium channels, the resulting flow of Na+ into the neuron results in further depolarization. Because the sodium channels are voltage gated, an increased depolarization causes more sodium channels to open, leading to an even greater flow of current. The result is a process of positive feedback (see Figure 1.13) that triggers a very rapid opening of all voltage-gated sodium channels and the marked change in membrane potential that defines an action potential (Figure 48.10c).

As the action potential proceeds, the sodium channels become inactivated: A loop of the channel protein moves, blocking ion flow through the opening.

An increase in the magnitude of the membrane potential is a hyperpolarization; a decrease is a depolarization. Changes in membrane potential that vary continuously with the strength of a stimulus are known as graded potentials. An action potential is a brief, all-or-none depolarization of a neuron's plasma membrane. When a graded depolarization brings the membrane potential to the threshold, many voltage-gated ion channels open, triggering an inflow of Na+ that rapidly brings the membrane potential to a positive value. A negative membrane potential is restored by the inactivation of sodium channels and by the opening of many voltage-gated potassium channels, which increases K+ outflow.

        <justification>The concept of entropy helps us understand why certain processes occur without any input of energy. It turns out that for a process to occur on its own, without outside help, it must increase the entropy of the universe. A process that can occur without an input of energy is called a spontaneous process. Note that as we're using it here, the word spontaneous does not imply that such a process would occur quickly; rather, the word signifies that the process is energetically favorable. (In fact, it may be helpful for you to think of the phrase "energetically favorable" when you read the formal term "spontaneous. ") Some spontaneous processes, such as an explosion, may be virtually instantaneous, while others, such as the rusting of an old car over time, are much slower. A process that cannot occur on its own is said to be nonspontaneous; it will happen only if energy is added to the system. We know from experience that certain events occur spontaneously and others do not. For instance, 
we know that water flows downhill spontaneously but moves uphill only with an input of energy, such as when a machine pumps the water against gravity. This understanding gives us another way to state the second law: For a process to occur spontaneously, it must increase the entropy of the universe.</justification>

        <justification>Recall that the universe is really equivalent to "the system" plus "the surroundings. " In 1878, J. Willard Gibbs, a professor at Yale, defined a very useful function called the Gibbs free energy of a system (without considering its surroundings), symbolized by the letter G. We'll refer to the Gibbs free energy simply as free energy. Free energy is the portion of a system's energy that can perform work when temperature and pressure are uniform throughout the system, as in a living cell. Let's consider how we determine the free-energy change that occurs when a system changes: for example, during a chemical reaction. The change in free energy, deltaG, can be calculated for a chemical reaction by applying the following equation: deltaG = deltaH -' TdeltaS This equation uses only properties of the system (the reaction) itself: deltaH symbolizes the change in the system's enthalpy (in biological systems, equivalent to total energy); deltaS is the change in the system's entropy; and T is the 
absolute temperature in Kelvin (K) units (K = degree C + 273; see Appendix C). Once we know the value of deltaG for a process, we can use it to predict whether the process will be spontaneous (that is, whether it is energetically favorable and will occur without an input of energy). More than a century of experiments has shown that only processes with a negative deltaG are spontaneous. For deltaG to be negative, either deltaH must be negative (the system gives up enthalpy and H decreases) or TdeltaS must be positive (the system gives up order and S increases), or both: When deltaH and TdeltaS are tallied, deltaG has a negative value (deltaG &amp;lt; 0) for all spontaneous processes. In other words, every spontaneous process decreases the system's free energy, and processes that have a positive or zero deltaG are never spontaneous. This information is immensely interesting to biologists, for it gives us the power to predict which kinds of change can happen without help. Such spontaneous changes can be 
harnessed to perform work. This principle is very important in the study of metabolism, where a major goal is to determine which reactions can supply energy for cellular work.</justification>

For a system at equilibrium, G is at its lowest possible value in that system. We can think of the equilibrium state as a free-energy valley. Any change from the equilibrium position will have a positive deltaG and will not be spontaneous. For this reason, systems never spontaneously move away from equilibrium.

Based on their free-energy changes, chemical reactions can be classified as either exergonic ("energy outward") or endergonic ("energy inward"). An exergonic reaction proceeds with a net release of free energy (Figure 8.6a). Because the chemical mixture loses free energy (G decreases), deltaG is negative for an exergonic reaction. Using deltaG as a standard for spontaneity, exergonic reactions are those that occur spontaneously. (Remember, the word spontaneous implies that it is energetically favorable, not that it will occur rapidly. ) The magnitude of deltaG for an exergonic reaction represents the maximum amount of work the reaction can perform. The word maximum qualifies this statement, because some of the free energy is released as heat and cannot do work.

The second law of thermodynamics states that spontaneous processes, those requiring no outside input of energy, increase the entropy (disorder) of the universe. Explain how the highly ordered structure of a cell does not conflict with the second law of thermodynamics. 8.2 The free-energy change of a reaction tells us whether or not the reaction occurs spontaneously (pp. 146-149) A living system's free energy is energy that can do work under cellular conditions. The change in free energy (deltaG) during a biological process is related directly to enthalpy change (deltaH) and to the change in entropy (deltaS): deltaG = deltaH - TdeltaS. Organisms live at the expense of free energy. During a spontaneous change, free energy decreases and the stability of a system increases. At maximum stability, the system is at equilibrium and can do no work. In an 
exergonic (spontaneous) chemical reaction, the products have less free energy than the reactants (-'deltaG). Endergonic (nonspontaneous) reactions require an input of energy (+deltaG).

    <text>How do kidney cells regulate the number of aquaporins expressed for water reabsorption?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>A combination of nervous and hormonal controls manages the osmoregulatory function of the mammalian kidney. One key hormone in this regulatory circuitry is antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called vasopressin. ADH is produced in the hypothalamus of the brain and stored in the posterior pituitary gland, located just below the hypothalamus. Osmoreceptor cells in the hypothalamus monitor the osmolarity of blood and regulate release of ADH from the posterior pituitary. Figure 44.19 Regulation of fluid retention in the kidney by antidiuretic hormone (ADH). To understand the role of ADH, let's consider what occurs when blood osmolarity rises, such as after eating salty food or losing water through sweating (Figure 44.19). In response to an increase in osmolarity above the set point of 300 mOsm/L, more ADH is released into the bloodstream. When ADH reaches the kidney, its main targets are the collecting ducts. There, ADH brings about changes that make the epithelium more permeable to water. 
The resulting increase in water reabsorption concentrates urine, reduces urine volume, and lowers blood osmolarity back toward the set point. (Only the gain of additional water in food and drink can fully restore osmolarity to 300 mOsm/L.) As the osmolarity of the blood subsides, a negative-feedback mechanism reduces the activity of osmoreceptor cells in the hypothalamus, and ADH secretion is reduced (not shown in figure). A reduction in blood osmolarity below the set point has the opposite set of effects. For example, intake of a large volume of water leads to a decrease in ADH secretion to a very low level. The resulting decrease in permeability of the collecting ducts reduces water reabsorption, resulting in discharge of large volumes of dilute urine. (Diuresis refers to increased urination, and ADH is called antidiuretic hormone because it opposes this state. ) Figure 44.20 ADH response pathway in the collecting duct. ADH influences water uptake in the kidney's collecting ducts by regulating the water-
selective channels formed by aquaporins. Binding of ADH to receptor molecules leads to a temporary increase in the number of aquaporin proteins in the membranes of collecting duct cells (Figure 44.20). Additional channels recapture more water, reducing urine volume.</justification>

        <justification>ATP is useful to the cell because the energy it releases on losing a phosphate group is somewhat greater than the energy most other molecules could deliver. But why does this hydrolysis release so much energy? If we reexamine the ATP molecule in Figure 8.8a, we can see that all three phosphate groups are negatively charged. These like charges are crowded together, and their mutual repulsion contributes to the instability of this region of the ATP molecule.

      <answer>
        <justification>The reactant an enzyme acts on is referred to as the enzyme's substrate. The enzyme binds to its substrate (or substrates, when there are two or more reactants), forming an enzyme-substrate complex. While enzyme and substrate are joined, the catalytic action of the enzyme converts the substrate to the product (or products) of the reaction. The overall process can be summarized as follows: Enzyme + Substrate(s)&amp;#8652;Enzyme-substrate complex&amp;#8652;Enzyme + Product(s) For example, the enzyme sucrase (most enzyme names end in -ase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the disaccharide sucrose into its two monosaccharides, glucose and fructose (see p. 152): Sucrose + Sucrose + H2O&amp;#8652;Sucrose-sucrose-H2O complex&amp;#8652;Sucrose + Glucose + Fructose The reaction catalyzed by each enzyme is very specific; an enzyme can recognize its specific substrate even among closely related compounds. For instance, sucrase will act only on sucrose and will not bind to other disaccharides, such as 
maltose. What accounts for this molecular recognition? Recall that most enzymes are proteins, and proteins are macromolecules with unique three-dimensional configurations. The specificity of an enzyme results from its shape, which is a consequence of its amino acid sequence. Figure 8.14 Induced fit between an enzyme and its substrate. Only a restricted region of the enzyme molecule actually binds to the substrate. This region, called the active site, is typically a pocket or groove on the surface of the enzyme where catalysis occurs (Figure 8.14a). Usually, the active site is formed by only a few of the enzyme's amino acids, with the rest of the protein molecule providing a framework that determines the configuration of the active site. The specificity of an enzyme is attributed to a compatible fit between the shape of its active site and the shape of the substrate. An enzyme is not a stiff structure locked into a given shape. In fact, recent work by biochemists has shown clearly that enzymes (and other 
proteins as well) seem to "dance" between subtly different shapes in a dynamic equilibrium, with slight differences in free energy for each "pose. " The shape that best fits the substrate isn't necessarily the one with the lowest energy, but during the very short time the enzyme takes on this shape, its active site can bind to the substrate. It has been known for more than 50 years that the active site itself is also not a rigid receptacle for the substrate. As the substrate enters the active site, the enzyme changes shape slightly due to interactions between the substrate's chemical groups and chemical groups on the side chains of the amino acids that form the active site. This shape change makes the active site fit even more snugly around the substrate (Figure 8.14b). This induced fit is like a clasping handshake. Induced fit brings chemical groups of the active site into positions that enhance their ability to catalyze the chemical reaction.</justification>

        <justification>Although the vertebrate oxygen transport protein hemoglobin is not an enzyme, classic studies of cooperative binding in this protein have elucidated the principle of cooperativity. Hemoglobin is made up of four subunits, each of which has an oxygen-binding site (see Figure 5.20). The binding of an oxygen molecule to one binding site increases the affinity for oxygen of the remaining binding sites. Thus, where oxygen is at high levels, such as in the lungs or gills, hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases as more binding sites are filled. In oxygen-deprived tissues, however, the release of each oxygen molecule decreases the oxygen affinity of the other binding sites, resulting in the release of oxygen where it is most needed. Cooperativity works similarly in multisubunit enzymes that have been studied.</justification>

        <justification>Erythrocytes Red blood cells, or erythrocytes, are by far the most numerous blood cells. Each microliter (microL, or mm3) of human blood contains 5-6 million red cells, and there are about 25 trillion of these cells in the body's 5 L of blood. Their main function is O2 transport, and their structure is closely related to this function. Human erythrocytes are small disks (7-8 microm in diameter) that are biconcave: thinner in the center than at the edges. This shape increases surface area, enhancing the rate of diffusion of O2 across their plasma membranes. Mature mammalian erythrocytes lack nuclei. This unusual characteristic leaves more space in these tiny cells for hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein that transports O2 (see Figure 5.20). Erythrocytes also lack mitochondria and generate their ATP exclusively by anaerobic metabolism. Oxygen transport would be less efficient if erythrocytes were aerobic and consumed some of the O2 they carry. Despite its small size, an erythrocyte 
contains about 250 million molecules of hemoglobin. Because each molecule of hemoglobin binds up to four molecules of O2, one erythrocyte can transport about a billion O2 molecules. As erythrocytes pass through the capillary beds of lungs, gills, or other respiratory organs, O2 diffuses into the erythrocytes and binds to hemoglobin. In the systemic capillaries, O2 dissociates from hemoglobin and diffuses into body cells.</justification>

        <justification>Vertebrate hemoglobin consists of four subunits (polypeptide chains), each with a cofactor called a heme group that has an iron atom at its center. Each iron atom binds one molecule of O2; hence, a single hemoglobin molecule can carry four molecules of O2. Like all respiratory pigments, hemoglobin binds O2 reversibly, loading O2 in the lungs or gills and unloading it in other parts of the body. This process depends on cooperativity between the hemoglobin subunits (see pp. 158-159). When O2 binds to one subunit, the others change shape slightly, increasing their affinity for O2. When four O2 molecules are bound and one subunit unloads its O2, the other three subunits more readily unload O2, as an associated shape change lowers their affinity for O2.</justification>

        <justification>A circulatory system has three basic components: a circulatory fluid, a set of interconnecting vessels, and a muscular pump, the heart. The heart powers circulation by using metabolic energy to elevate the hydrostatic pressure of the circulatory fluid, which then flows through the vessels and back to the heart. By transporting fluid throughout the body, the circulatory system functionally connects the aqueous environment of the body cells to the organs that exchange gases, absorb nutrients, and dispose of wastes. In mammals, for example, O2 from inhaled air diffuses across only two layers of cells in the lungs before reaching the blood. The circulatory system, powered by the heart, then carries the oxygen-rich blood to all parts of the body. As the blood streams throughout the body tissues in tiny blood vessels, O2 in the blood diffuses only a short distance before entering the fluid that directly bathes the cells. Several basic types of circulatory systems have arisen during evolution,
 each representing adaptations to constraints imposed by anatomy and environment. Circulatory systems are either open or closed, vary with regard to the number of circuits in the body, and rely on pumps that differ in structure and organization.</justification>

(The circled numbers refer to corresponding locations in Figure 42.6. ) Contraction of the right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. As the blood flows through capillary beds in the left and right lungs, it loads O2 and unloads CO2. Oxygen-rich blood returns from the lungs via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium of the heart. Next, the oxygen-rich blood flows into the heart's left ventricle, which pumps the oxygen-rich blood out to body tissues through the systemic circuit. Blood leaves the left ventricle via the aorta, which conveys blood to arteries leading throughout the body. The first branches leading from the aorta are the coronary arteries (not shown), which supply blood to the heart muscle itself. Then branches lead to capillary beds in the head and arms (forelimbs). The aorta then descends into the abdomen, supplying oxygen-
rich blood to arteries leading to capillary beds in the abdominal organs and legs (hind limbs). Within the capillaries, there is a net diffusion of O2 from the blood to the tissues and of CO2 (produced by cellular respiration) into the blood. Capillaries rejoin, forming venules, which convey blood to veins. Oxygen-poor blood from the head, neck, and forelimbs is channeled into a large vein, the superior vena cava.</justification>

    <text>How do the three types of cellular work differ from one another?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>In most cases in the cell, however, the generation of heat alone would be an inefficient (and potentially dangerous) use of a valuable energy resource. Instead, the cell's proteins harness the energy released during ATP hydrolysis in several ways to perform the three types of cellular work: chemical, transport, and mechanical. Figure 8.9 How ATP drives chemical work: Energy coupling using ATP hydrolysis. In this example, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis is used to drive an endergonic process: the cellular synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid and ammonia. For example, with the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to use the energy released by ATP hydrolysis directly to drive chemical reactions that, by themselves, are endergonic. If the deltaG of an endergonic reaction is less than the amount of energy released by ATP hydrolysis, then the two reactions can be coupled so that, overall, the coupled reactions are exergonic (Figure 8.9). This usually 
involves the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to some other molecule, such as the reactant. The recipient with the phosphate group covalently bonded to it is then called a phosphorylated intermediate. The key to coupling exergonic and endergonic reactions is the formation of this phosphorylated intermediate, which is more reactive (less stable) than the original unphosphorylated molecule. Figure 8.10 How ATP drives transport and mechanical work. ATP hydrolysis causes changes in the shapes and binding affinities of proteins. This can occur either (a) directly, by phosphorylation, as shown for a membrane protein carrying out active transport of a solute (see also Figure 7.18), or (b) indirectly, via noncovalent binding of ATP and its hydrolytic products, as is the case for motor proteins that move vesicles (and other organelles) along cytoskeletal "tracks" in the cell (see also Figure 6.21). Transport and mechanical work in the cell are also nearly always powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. In these cases, 
ATP hydrolysis leads to a change in a protein's shape and often its ability to bind another molecule. Sometimes this occurs via a phosphorylated intermediate, as seen for the transport protein in Figure 8.10a. In most instances of mechanical work involving motor proteins "walking" along cytoskeletal elements (Figure 8.10b), a cycle occurs in which ATP is first bound noncovalently to the motor protein. Next, ATP is hydrolyzed, releasing ADP and &amp;#9413;i. Another ATP molecule can then bind. At each stage, the motor protein changes its shape and ability to bind the cytoskeleton, resulting in movement of the protein along the cytoskeletal track.</justification>

Recall that catabolic pathways release energy by breaking down complex molecules. Biologists say that these complex molecules, such as glucose, are high in chemical energy. During a catabolic reaction, some bonds are broken and others formed, releasing energy and resulting in lower-energy breakdown products. This transformation also occurs, for example, in the engine of a car when the hydrocarbons of gasoline react explosively with oxygen, releasing the energy that pushes the pistons and producing exhaust. Although less explosive, a similar reaction of food molecules with oxygen provides chemical energy in biological systems, producing carbon dioxide and water as waste products. Biochemical pathways, carried out in the context of cellular structures, enable cells to release chemical energy from food molecules and use the energy to power life processes.</justification>

Recall that the complete oxidation of a mole of glucose releases 686 kcal of energy under standard conditions (deltaG = -'686 kcal/mol). Phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP stores at least 7.3 kcal per mole of ATP. Therefore, the efficiency of respiration is 7.3 kcal per mole of ATP times 32 moles of ATP per mole of glucose divided by 686 kcal per mole of glucose, which equals 0.34. Thus, about 34% of the potential chemical energy in glucose has been transferred to ATP; the actual percentage is probably higher because deltaG is lower under cellular conditions.

Metabolic rate can also be determined from the amount of oxygen consumed or carbon dioxide produced by an animal's cellular respiration (Figure 40.18). To calculate metabolic rate over longer periods, researchers record the rate of food consumption, the energy content of the food (about 4.5-5 kcal per gram of protein or carbohydrate and about 9 kcal per gram of fat), and the chemical energy lost in waste products (feces and nitrogenous waste).</justification>

    <text>How fluid are lipids?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>A membrane remains fluid as temperature decreases until finally the phospholipids settle into a closely packed arrangement and the membrane solidifies, much as bacon grease forms lard when it cools. The temperature at which a membrane solidifies depends on the types of lipids it is made of. The membrane remains fluid to a lower temperature if it is rich in phospholipids with unsaturated hydrocarbon tails (see Figures 5.11 and 5.12). Because of kinks in the tails where double bonds are located, unsaturated hydrocarbon tails cannot pack together as closely as saturated hydrocarbon tails, and this makes the membrane more fluid (Figure 7.8a). Figure 7.8 Factors that affect membrane fluidity. The steroid cholesterol, which is wedged between phospholipid molecules in the plasma membranes of animal cells, has different effects on membrane fluidity at different temperatures (Figure 7.8b). At relatively high temperatures: at 37 degree C, the body temperature of humans, for example: cholesterol 
makes the membrane less fluid by restraining phospholipid movement. However, because cholesterol also hinders the close packing of phospholipids, it lowers the temperature required for the membrane to solidify. Thus, cholesterol can be thought of as a "fluidity buffer" for the membrane, resisting changes in membrane fluidity that can be caused by changes in temperature. Membranes must be fluid to work properly; they are usually about as fluid as salad oil. When a membrane solidifies, its permeability changes, and enzymatic proteins in the membrane may become inactive if their activity requires them to be able to move within the membrane. However, membranes that are too fluid cannot support protein function either. Therefore, extreme environments pose a challenge for life, resulting in evolutionary adaptations that include differences in membrane lipid composition.</justification>

        <justification>EVOLUTION Variations in the cell membrane lipid compositions of many species appear to be evolutionary adaptations that maintain the appropriate membrane fluidity under specific environmental conditions. For instance, fishes that live in extreme cold have membranes with a high proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbon tails, enabling their membranes to remain fluid (see Figure 7.8a). At the other extreme, some bacteria and archaea thrive at temperatures greater than 90 degree C (194 degree F) in thermal hot springs and geysers. Their membranes include unusual lipids that may prevent excessive fluidity at such high temperatures. The ability to change the lipid composition of cell membranes in response to changing temperatures has evolved in organisms that live where temperatures vary. In many plants that tolerate extreme cold, such as winter wheat, the percentage of unsaturated phospholipids increases in autumn, an adjustment that keeps the membranes from solidifying during winter. Certain 
bacteria and archaea can also change the proportion of unsaturated phospholipids in their cell membranes, depending on the temperature at which they are growing. Overall, natural selection has apparently favored organisms whose mix of membrane lipids ensures an appropriate level of membrane fluidity for their environment.</justification>

A membrane is held together primarily by hydrophobic interactions, which are much weaker than covalent bonds (see Figure 5.20). Most of the lipids and some of the proteins can shift about laterally: that is, in the plane of the membrane, like partygoers elbowing their way through a crowded room (Figure 7.6). It is quite rare, however, for a molecule to flip-flop transversely across the membrane, switching from one phospholipid layer to the other; to do so, the hydrophilic part of the molecule must cross the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. The lateral movement of phospholipids within the membrane is rapid. Adjacent phospholipids switch positions about 107 times per second, which means that a phospholipid can travel about 2 microm: the length of many bacterial cells: in 1 second.</justification>

Proteins with related functions often cluster in patches. Phospholipids and some proteins move laterally within the membrane. The unsaturated hydrocarbon tails of some phospholipids keep membranes fluid at lower temperatures, while cholesterol helps membranes resist changes in fluidity caused by temperature changes.

        <justification>Figure 9.13 Free-energy change during electron transport. The overall energy drop (deltaG) for electrons traveling from NADH to oxygen is 53 kcal/mol, but this "fall" is broken up into a series of smaller steps by the electron transport chain. (An oxygen atom is represented here as 1/2 O2 to emphasize that the electron transport chain reduces molecular oxygen, O2, not individual oxygen atoms. ) Figure 9.13 shows the sequence of electron carriers in the electron transport chain and the drop in free energy as electrons travel down the chain. During electron transport along the chain, electron carriers alternate between reduced and oxidized states as they accept and donate electrons. Each component of the chain becomes reduced when it accepts electrons from its "uphill" neighbor, which has a lower affinity for electrons (is less electronegative). It then returns to its oxidized form as it passes electrons to its "downhill," more electronegative neighbor.</justification>

        <justification>We'll first describe the passage of electrons through complex I in some detail, as an illustration of the general principles involved in electron transport. Electrons removed from glucose by NAD+, during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, are transferred from NADH to the first molecule of the electron transport chain in complex I. This molecule is a flavoprotein, so named because it has a prosthetic group called flavin mononucleotide (FMN). In the next redox reaction, the flavoprotein returns to its oxidized form as it passes electrons to an iron-sulfur protein (Fe. S in complex I), one of a family of proteins with both iron and sulfur tightly bound. The iron-sulfur protein then passes the electrons to a compound called ubiquinone (Q in Figure 9.13). This electron carrier is a small hydrophobic molecule, the only member of the electron transport chain that is not a protein. Ubiquinone is individually mobile within the membrane rather than residing in a particular complex. (Another 
name for ubiquinone is coenzyme Q, or CoQ; you may have seen it sold as a nutritional supplement. ) Most of the remaining electron carriers between ubiquinone and oxygen are proteins called cytochromes. Their prosthetic group, called a heme group, has an iron atom that accepts and donates electrons. (It is similar to the heme group in hemoglobin, the protein of red blood cells, except that the iron in hemoglobin carries oxygen, not electrons. ) The electron transport chain has several types of cytochromes, each a different protein with a slightly different electron-carrying heme group. The last cytochrome of the chain, cyt a3, passes its electrons to oxygen, which is very electronegative. Each oxygen atom also picks up a pair of hydrogen ions from the aqueous solution, forming water. Another source of electrons for the transport chain is FADH2, the other reduced product of the citric acid cycle. Notice in Figure 9.13 that FADH2 adds its electrons to the electron transport chain from within complex II, at a 
lower energy level than NADH does. Consequently, although NADH and FADH2 each donate an equivalent number of electrons (2) for oxygen reduction, the electron transport chain provides about one-third less energy for ATP synthesis when the electron donor is FADH2 rather than NADH. We'll see why in the next section. The electron transport chain makes no ATP directly. Instead, it eases the fall of electrons from food to oxygen, breaking a large free-energy drop into a series of smaller steps that release energy in manageable amounts.</justification>

        <justification>How do electrons that are extracted from glucose and stored as potential energy in NADH finally reach oxygen? It will help to compare the redox chemistry of cellular respiration to a much simpler reaction: the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water (Figure 9.5a). Mix H2 and O2, provide a spark for activation energy, and the gases combine explosively. In fact, combustion of liquid H2 and O2 is harnessed to power the main engines of the space shuttle after it is launched, boosting it into orbit. The explosion represents a release of energy as the electrons of hydrogen "fall" closer to the electronegative oxygen atoms. Cellular respiration also brings hydrogen and oxygen together to form water, but there are two important differences. First, in cellular respiration, the hydrogen that reacts with oxygen is derived from organic molecules rather than H2. Second, instead of occurring in one explosive reaction, respiration uses an electron transport chain to break the fall of 
electrons to oxygen into several energy-releasing steps (Figure 9.5b). An electron transport chain consists of a number of molecules, mostly proteins, built into the inner membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and the plasma membrane of aerobically respiring prokaryotes. Electrons removed from glucose are shuttled by NADH to the "top," higher-energy end of the chain. At the "bottom," lower-energy end, O2 captures these electrons along with hydrogen nuclei (H+), forming water. Electron transfer from NADH to oxygen is an exergonic reaction with a free-energy change of -'53 kcal/mol (-'222 kJ/mol). Instead of this energy being released and wasted in a single explosive step, electrons cascade down the chain from one carrier molecule to the next in a series of redox reactions, losing a small amount of energy with each step until they finally reach oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor, which has a very great affinity for electrons. Each "downhill" carrier is more electronegative than, and thus capable 
of oxidizing, its "uphill" neighbor, with oxygen at the bottom of the chain. Therefore, the electrons removed from glucose by NAD+ fall down an energy gradient in the electron transport chain to a far more stable location in the electronegative oxygen atom. Put another way, oxygen pulls electrons down the chain in an energy-yielding tumble analogous to gravity pulling objects downhill.</justification>

        <justification>Instead of heat, organisms use catalysis to speed up reactions. Figure 8.13 The effect of an enzyme on activation energy. Without affecting the free-energy change (deltaG) for a reaction, an enzyme speeds the reaction by reducing its activation energy (EA). An enzyme catalyzes a reaction by lowering the EA barrier (Figure 8.13), enabling the reactant molecules to absorb enough energy to reach the transition state even at moderate temperatures. An enzyme cannot change the deltaG for a reaction; it cannot make an endergonic reaction exergonic. Enzymes can only hasten reactions that would eventually occur anyway, but this function makes it possible for the cell to have a dynamic metabolism, routing chemicals smoothly through the cell's metabolic pathways. And because enzymes are very specific for the reactions they catalyze, they determine which chemical processes will be going on in the cell at any particular time.</justification>

        <justification>The reactant an enzyme acts on is referred to as the enzyme's substrate. The enzyme binds to its substrate (or substrates, when there are two or more reactants), forming an enzyme-substrate complex. While enzyme and substrate are joined, the catalytic action of the enzyme converts the substrate to the product (or products) of the reaction. The overall process can be summarized as follows: Enzyme + Substrate(s)&amp;#8652;Enzyme-substrate complex&amp;#8652;Enzyme + Product(s) For example, the enzyme sucrase (most enzyme names end in -ase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the disaccharide sucrose into its two monosaccharides, glucose and fructose (see p. 152): Sucrose + Sucrose + H2O&amp;#8652;Sucrose-sucrose-H2O complex&amp;#8652;Sucrose + Glucose + Fructose The reaction catalyzed by each enzyme is very specific; an enzyme can recognize its specific substrate even among closely related compounds. For instance, sucrase will act only on sucrose and will not bind to other disaccharides, such as 
maltose. What accounts for this molecular recognition? Recall that most enzymes are proteins, and proteins are macromolecules with unique three-dimensional configurations. The specificity of an enzyme results from its shape, which is a consequence of its amino acid sequence. Figure 8.14 Induced fit between an enzyme and its substrate. Only a restricted region of the enzyme molecule actually binds to the substrate. This region, called the active site, is typically a pocket or groove on the surface of the enzyme where catalysis occurs (Figure 8.14a). Usually, the active site is formed by only a few of the enzyme's amino acids, with the rest of the protein molecule providing a framework that determines the configuration of the active site. The specificity of an enzyme is attributed to a compatible fit between the shape of its active site and the shape of the substrate. An enzyme is not a stiff structure locked into a given shape. In fact, recent work by biochemists has shown clearly that enzymes (and other 
proteins as well) seem to "dance" between subtly different shapes in a dynamic equilibrium, with slight differences in free energy for each "pose. " The shape that best fits the substrate isn't necessarily the one with the lowest energy, but during the very short time the enzyme takes on this shape, its active site can bind to the substrate. It has been known for more than 50 years that the active site itself is also not a rigid receptacle for the substrate. As the substrate enters the active site, the enzyme changes shape slightly due to interactions between the substrate's chemical groups and chemical groups on the side chains of the amino acids that form the active site. This shape change makes the active site fit even more snugly around the substrate (Figure 8.14b). This induced fit is like a clasping handshake. Induced fit brings chemical groups of the active site into positions that enhance their ability to catalyze the chemical reaction.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 8.15 The active site and catalytic cycle of an enzyme. An enzyme can convert one or more reactant molecules to one or more product molecules. The enzyme shown here converts two substrate molecules to two product molecules. In most enzymatic reactions, the substrate is held in the active site by so-called weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds. R groups of a few of the amino acids that make up the active site catalyze the conversion of substrate to product, and the product departs from the active site. The enzyme is then free to take another substrate molecule into its active site. The entire cycle happens so fast that a single enzyme molecule typically acts on about a thousand substrate molecules per second. Some enzymes are much faster. Enzymes, like other catalysts, emerge from the reaction in their original form. Therefore, very small amounts of enzyme can have a huge metabolic impact by functioning over and over again in catalytic cycles. Figure 8.15 shows 
a catalytic cycle involving two substrates and two products. Most metabolic reactions are reversible, and an enzyme can catalyze either the forward or the reverse reaction, depending on which direction has a negative deltaG. This in turn depends mainly on the relative concentrations of reactants and products. The net effect is always in the direction of equilibrium. Enzymes use a variety of mechanisms that lower activation energy and speed up a reaction (see Figure 8.15, step &amp;#10114;). First, in reactions involving two or more reactants, the active site provides a template on which the substrates can come together in the proper orientation for a reaction to occur between them. Second, as the active site of an enzyme clutches the bound substrates, the enzyme may stretch the substrate molecules toward their transition-state form, stressing and bending critical chemical bonds that must be broken during the reaction. Because EA is proportional to the difficulty of breaking the bonds, distorting the 
substrate helps it approach the transition state and thus reduces the amount of free energy that must be absorbed to achieve that state. Third, the active site may also provide a microenvironment that is more conducive to a particular type of reaction than the solution itself would be without the enzyme. For example, if the active site has amino acids with acidic R groups, the active site may be a pocket of low pH in an otherwise neutral cell. In such cases, an acidic amino acid may facilitate H+ transfer to the substrate as a key step in catalyzing the reaction. A fourth mechanism of catalysis is the direct participation of the active site in the chemical reaction. Sometimes this process even involves brief covalent bonding between the substrate and the side chain of an amino acid of the enzyme. Subsequent steps of the reaction restore the side chains to their original states, so that the active site is the same after the reaction as it was before.</justification>

        <justification>Chlorophyll molecules excited by the absorption of light energy produce very different results in an intact chloroplast than they do in isolation (see Figure 10.12). In their native environment of the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll molecules are organized along with other small organic molecules and proteins into complexes called photosystems. Figure 10.13 The structure and function of a photosystem. A photosystem is composed of a reaction-center complex surrounded by several light-harvesting complexes (Figure 10.13). The reaction-center complex is an organized association of proteins holding a special pair of chlorophyll a molecules. Each light-harvesting complex consists of various pigment molecules (which may include chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids) bound to proteins. The number and variety of pigment molecules enable a photosystem to harvest light over a larger surface area and a larger portion of the spectrum than could any single pigment molecule alone. Together, 
these light-harvesting complexes act as an antenna for the reaction-center complex. When a pigment molecule absorbs a photon, the energy is transferred from pigment molecule to pigment molecule within a light-harvesting complex, somewhat like a human "wave" at a sports arena, until it is passed into the reaction-center complex. The reaction-center complex also contains a molecule capable of accepting electrons and becoming reduced; this is called the primary electron acceptor. The pair of chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction-center complex are special because their molecular environment: their location and the other molecules with which they are associated: enables them to use the energy from light not only to boost one of their electrons to a higher energy level, but also to transfer it to a different molecule: the primary electron acceptor. The solar-powered transfer of an electron from the reaction- center chlorophyll a pair to the primary electron acceptor is the first step of the light reactions. As 
soon as the chlorophyll electron is excited to a higher energy level, the primary electron acceptor captures it; this is a redox reaction. In the flask shown in Figure 10.12, isolated chlorophyll fluoresces because there is no electron acceptor, so electrons of photoexcited chlorophyll drop right back to the ground state. In the structured environment of a chloroplast, however, an electron acceptor is readily available, and the potential energy represented by the excited electron is not dissipated as light and heat. Thus, each photosystem: a reaction-center complex surrounded by light-harvesting complexes: functions in the chloroplast as a unit.</justification>

It excites an electron in this pair of chlorophylls to a higher energy state. This electron is transferred from the excited P680 to the primary electron acceptor. We can refer to the resulting form of P680, missing an electron, as P680+. An enzyme catalyzes the splitting of a water molecule into two electrons, two hydrogen ions (H+), and an oxygen atom.

        <justification>As we described in Chapter 6, the cell secretes certain biological molecules by the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane; this process is called exocytosis. A transport vesicle that has budded from the Golgi apparatus moves along microtubules of the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. When the vesicle membrane and plasma membrane come into contact, specific proteins rearrange the lipid molecules of the two bilayers so that the two membranes fuse. The contents of the vesicle then spill to the outside of the cell, and the vesicle membrane becomes part of the plasma membrane (see Figure 7.12, step 4). Many secretory cells use exocytosis to export products. For example, the cells in the pancreas that make insulin secrete it into the extracellular fluid by exocytosis. In another example, neurons (nerve cells) use exocytosis to release neurotransmitters that signal other neurons or muscle cells. When plant cells are making walls, exocytosis delivers proteins and carbohydrates from 
Golgi vesicles to the outside of the cell.</justification>

        <justification>The electron transport chain is a collection of molecules embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion in eukaryotic cells. (In prokaryotes, these molecules reside in the plasma membrane. ) The folding of the inner membrane to form cristae increases its surface area, providing space for thousands of copies of the chain in each mitochondrion. (Once again, we see that structure fits function. ) Most components of the chain are proteins, which exist in multiprotein complexes numbered I through IV. Tightly bound to these proteins are prosthetic groups, nonprotein components essential for the catalytic functions of certain enzymes. Figure 9.13 Free-energy change during electron transport. The overall energy drop (deltaG) for electrons traveling from NADH to oxygen is 53 kcal/mol, but this "fall" is broken up into a series of smaller steps by the electron transport chain. (An oxygen atom is represented here as 1/2 O2 to emphasize that the electron transport chain reduces molecular 
oxygen, O2, not individual oxygen atoms. ) Figure 9.13 shows the sequence of electron carriers in the electron transport chain and the drop in free energy as electrons travel down the chain. During electron transport along the chain, electron carriers alternate between reduced and oxidized states as they accept and donate electrons. Each component of the chain becomes reduced when it accepts electrons from its "uphill" neighbor, which has a lower affinity for electrons (is less electronegative). It then returns to its oxidized form as it passes electrons to its "downhill," more electronegative neighbor. Now let's take a closer look at the electron transport chain in Figure 9.13. We'll first describe the passage of electrons through complex I in some detail, as an illustration of the general principles involved in electron transport. Electrons removed from glucose by NAD+, during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, are transferred from NADH to the first molecule of the electron transport chain in complex I. 
This molecule is a flavoprotein, so named because it has a prosthetic group called flavin mononucleotide (FMN). In the next redox reaction, the flavoprotein returns to its oxidized form as it passes electrons to an iron-sulfur protein (Fe. S in complex I), one of a family of proteins with both iron and sulfur tightly bound. The iron-sulfur protein then passes the electrons to a compound called ubiquinone (Q in Figure 9.13). This electron carrier is a small hydrophobic molecule, the only member of the electron transport chain that is not a protein. Ubiquinone is individually mobile within the membrane rather than residing in a particular complex. (Another name for ubiquinone is coenzyme Q, or CoQ; you may have seen it sold as a nutritional supplement. ) Most of the remaining electron carriers between ubiquinone and oxygen are proteins called cytochromes. Their prosthetic group, called a heme group, has an iron atom that accepts and donates electrons. (It is similar to the heme group in hemoglobin, the protein 
of red blood cells, except that the iron in hemoglobin carries oxygen, not electrons. ) The electron transport chain has several types of cytochromes, each a different protein with a slightly different electron-carrying heme group. The last cytochrome of the chain, cyt a3, passes its electrons to oxygen, which is very electronegative. Each oxygen atom also picks up a pair of hydrogen ions from the aqueous solution, forming water. Another source of electrons for the transport chain is FADH2, the other reduced product of the citric acid cycle. Notice in Figure 9.13 that FADH2 adds its electrons to the electron transport chain from within complex II, at a lower energy level than NADH does. Consequently, although NADH and FADH2 each donate an equivalent number of electrons (2) for oxygen reduction, the electron transport chain provides about one-third less energy for ATP synthesis when the electron donor is FADH2 rather than NADH.</justification>

        <justification>Each photoexcited electron passes from the primary electron acceptor of PS II to PS I via an electron transport chain, the components of which are similar to those of the electron transport chain that functions in cellular respiration. The electron transport chain between PS II and PS I is made up of the electron carrier plastoquinone (Pq), a cytochrome complex, and a protein called plastocyanin (Pc). The exergonic "fall" of electrons to a lower energy level provides energy for the synthesis of ATP. As electrons pass through the cytochrome complex, H+ are pumped into the thylakoid lumen, contributing to the proton gradient that is subsequently used in chemiosmosis. Meanwhile, light energy has been transferred via light-harvesting complex pigments to the PS I reaction-center complex, exciting an electron of the P700 pair of chlorophyll a molecules located there. The photoexcited electron was then transferred to PS I's primary electron acceptor, creating an electron "hole" in the P700: 
which we now can call P700+. In other words, P700+ can now act as an electron acceptor, accepting an electron that reaches the bottom of the electron transport chain from PS II.

    <text>How is aerobic respiration related to cellular respiration?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>One catabolic process, fermentation, is a partial degradation of sugars or other organic fuel that occurs without the use of oxygen. However, the most prevalent and efficient catabolic pathway is aerobic respiration, in which oxygen is consumed as a reactant along with the organic fuel (aerobic is from the Greek aer, air, and bios, life). The cells of most eukaryotic and many prokaryotic organisms can carry out aerobic respiration. Some prokaryotes use substances other than oxygen as reactants in a similar process that harvests chemical energy without oxygen; this process is called anaerobic respiration (the prefix an- means "without"). Technically, the term cellular respiration includes both aerobic and anaerobic processes. However, it originated as a synonym for aerobic respiration because of the relationship of that process to organismal respiration, in which an animal breathes in oxygen. Thus, cellular respiration is often used to refer to the aerobic process, a practice we follow

        <justification>Fermentation, anaerobic respiration, and aerobic respiration are three alternative cellular pathways for producing ATP by harvesting the chemical energy of food. All three use glycolysis to oxidize glucose and other organic fuels to pyruvate, with a net production of 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. And in all three pathways, NAD+ is the oxidizing agent that accepts electrons from food during glycolysis. A key difference among the three pathways is the contrasting mechanisms for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which is required to sustain glycolysis. In fermentation, the final electron acceptor is an organic molecule such as pyruvate (lactic acid fermentation) or acetaldehyde (alcohol fermentation). In cellular respiration, by contrast, electrons carried by NADH are transferred to an electron transport chain, where they move stepwise down a series of redox reactions to a final electron acceptor. In aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is oxygen; in anaerobic 
respiration, the final acceptor is another molecule that is electronegative (although invariably less so than oxygen).

    <text>How do proteins hydrolyze atp?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 8.8 The structure and hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP (adenosine triphosphate) was introduced in Chapter 4 when we discussed the phosphate group as a functional group. ATP contains the sugar ribose, with the nitrogenous base adenine and a chain of three phosphate groups bonded to it (Figure 8.8a). In addition to its role in energy coupling, ATP is also one of the nucleoside triphosphates used to make RNA (see Figure 5.26). The bonds between the phosphate groups of ATP can be broken by hydrolysis. When the terminal phosphate bond is broken by addition of a water molecule, a molecule of inorganic phosphate (HOPO32-, abbreviated &amp;#9413;i throughout this book) leaves the ATP, which becomes adenosine diphosphate, or ADP (Figure 8.8b). The reaction is exergonic and releases 7.3 kcal of energy per mole of ATP hydrolyzed: ATP + H2O &amp;rarr; ADP + &amp;#9413;i &amp;Delta;G = -'7.3 kcal/mol (-'30.5 kJ/mol) This is the free-energy change measured under standard 
conditions. In the cell, conditions do not conform to standard conditions, primarily because reactant and product concentrations differ from 1 M. For example, when ATP hydrolysis occurs under cellular conditions, the actual deltaG is about -'13 kcal/mol, 78% greater than the energy released by ATP hydrolysis under standard conditions. Because their hydrolysis releases energy, the phosphate bonds of ATP are sometimes referred to as high-energy phosphate bonds, but the term is misleading. The phosphate bonds of ATP are not unusually strong bonds, as "high-energy" may imply; rather, the reactants (ATP and water) themselves have high energy relative to the energy of the products (ADP and &amp;#9413;i). The release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change to a state of lower free energy, not from the phosphate bonds themselves.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 8.21 Feedback inhibition in isoleucine synthesis. When ATP allosterically inhibits an enzyme in an ATP-generating pathway, as we discussed earlier, the result is feedback inhibition, a common mode of metabolic control. In feedback inhibition, a metabolic pathway is switched off by the inhibitory binding of its end product to an enzyme that acts early in the pathway. Figure 8.21 shows an example of this control mechanism operating on an anabolic pathway. Certain cells use this five-step pathway to synthesize the amino acid isoleucine from threonine, another amino acid. As isoleucine accumulates, it slows down its own synthesis by allosterically inhibiting the enzyme for the first step of the pathway. Feedback inhibition thereby prevents the cell from wasting chemical resources by making more isoleucine than is necessary.</justification>

The activity of the first enzyme in the tryptophan synthesis pathway is inhibited by the pathway's end product (Figure 18.2a). Thus, if tryptophan accumulates in a cell, it shuts down the synthesis of more tryptophan by inhibiting enzyme activity. Such feedback inhibition, typical of anabolic (biosynthetic) pathways, allows a cell to adapt to short-term fluctuations in the supply of a substance it needs.</justification>

    <text>How do transport proteins work?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>These hydrophilic substances can avoid contact with the lipid bilayer by passing through transport proteins that span the membrane. Some transport proteins, called channel proteins, function by having a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or atomic ions use as a tunnel through the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, left). For example, the passage of water molecules through the membrane in certain cells is greatly facilitated by channel proteins known as aquaporins. Each aquaporin allows entry of up to 3 billion (3 * 109) water molecules per second, passing single file through its central channel, which fits ten at a time. Without aquaporins, only a tiny fraction of these water molecules would pass through the same area of the cell membrane in a second, so the channel protein brings about a tremendous increase in rate. Other transport proteins, called carrier proteins, hold onto their passengers and change shape in a way that shuttles them across the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, right). 
A transport protein is specific for the substance it translocates (moves), allowing only a certain substance (or a small group of related substances) to cross the membrane. For example, a specific carrier protein in the plasma membrane of red blood cells transports glucose across the membrane 50,000 times faster than glucose can pass through on its own. This "glucose transporter" is so selective that it even rejects fructose, a structural isomer of glucose. Thus, the selective permeability of a membrane depends on both the discriminating barrier of the lipid bilayer and the specific transport proteins built into the membrane.</justification>

        <justification>Let's look more closely at how water and certain hydrophilic solutes cross a membrane. As mentioned earlier, many polar molecules and ions impeded by the lipid bilayer of the membrane diffuse passively with the help of transport proteins that span the membrane. This phenomenon is called facilitated diffusion. Cell biologists are still trying to learn exactly how various transport proteins facilitate diffusion. Most transport proteins are very specific: They transport some substances but not others. Figure 7.17 Two types of transport proteins that carry out facilitated diffusion. In both cases, the protein can transport the solute in either direction, but the net movement is down the concentration gradient of the solute. As described earlier, the two types of transport proteins are channel proteins and carrier proteins. Channel proteins simply provide corridors that allow specific molecules or ions to cross the membrane (Figure 7.17a). The hydrophilic passageways provided by these 
proteins can allow water molecules or small ions to diffuse very quickly from one side of the membrane to the other. Aquaporins, the water channel proteins, facilitate the massive amounts of diffusion that occur in plant cells and in animal cells such as red blood cells (see Figure 7.15). Certain kidney cells also have a high number of aquaporins, allowing them to reclaim water from urine before it is excreted. If the kidneys did not perform this function, you would excrete about 180 L of urine per day: and have to drink an equal volume of water! Channel proteins that transport ions are called ion channels. Many ion channels function as gated channels, which open or close in response to a stimulus. For some gated channels, the stimulus is electrical. The ion channel shown in Figure 7.1, for example, opens in response to an electrical stimulus, allowing potassium ions to leave the cell. Other gated channels open or close when a specific substance other than the one to be transported binds to the channel. Both 
types of gated channels are important in the functioning of the nervous system, as you'll learn in Chapter 48. Carrier proteins, such as the glucose transporter mentioned earlier, seem to undergo a subtle change in shape that somehow translocates the solute-binding site across the membrane (Figure 7.17b). Such a change in shape may be triggered by the binding and release of the transported molecule. Like ion channels, carrier proteins involved in facilitated diffusion result in the net movement of a substance down its concentration gradient. No energy input is thus required: This is passive transport. In certain inherited diseases, specific transport systems are either defective or missing altogether. An example is cystinuria, a human disease characterized by the absence of a carrier protein that transports cysteine and some other amino acids across the membranes of kidney cells. Kidney cells normally reabsorb these amino acids from the urine and return them to the blood, but an individual afflicted with 
cystinuria develops painful stones from amino acids that accumulate and crystallize in the kidneys.</justification>

        <justification>Despite the help of transport proteins, facilitated diffusion is considered passive transport because the solute is moving down its concentration gradient, a process that requires no energy. Facilitated diffusion speeds transport of a solute by providing efficient passage through the membrane, but it does not alter the direction of transport. Some transport proteins, however, can move solutes against their concentration gradients, across the plasma membrane from the side where they are less concentrated (whether inside or outside) to the side where they are more concentrated.</justification>

        <justification>To pump a solute across a membrane against its gradient requires work; the cell must expend energy. Therefore, this type of membrane traffic is called active transport. The transport proteins that move solutes against their concentration gradients are all carrier proteins rather than channel proteins. This makes sense because when channel proteins are open, they merely allow solutes to diffuse down their concentration gradients rather than picking them up and transporting them against their gradients. Figure 7.18 The sodium-potassium pump: a specific case of active transport. This transport system pumps ions against steep concentration gradients: Sodium ion concentration ([Na+]) is high outside the cell and low inside, while potassium ion concentration ([K+]) is low outside the cell and high inside. The pump oscillates between two shapes in a cycle that moves 3 Na+ out of the cell for every 2 K+ pumped into the cell. The two shapes have different affinities for Na+ and K+. ATP powers 
the shape change by transferring a phosphate group to the transport protein (phosphorylating the protein). Active transport enables a cell to maintain internal concentrations of small solutes that differ from concentrations in its environment. For example, compared with its surroundings, an animal cell has a much higher concentration of potassium ions (K+) and a much lower concentration of sodium ions (Na+). The plasma membrane helps maintain these steep gradients by pumping Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell. Figure 7.19 Review: passive and active transport. As in other types of cellular work, ATP supplies the energy for most active transport. One way ATP can power active transport is by transferring its terminal phosphate group directly to the transport protein. This can induce the protein to change its shape in a manner that translocates a solute bound to the protein across the membrane. One transport system that works this way is the sodium-potassium pump, which exchanges Na+ for K+ across the 
plasma membrane of animal cells (Figure 7.18). The distinction between passive transport and active transport is reviewed in Figure 7.19.</justification>

        <justification>A single ATP-powered pump that transports a specific solute can indirectly drive the active transport of several other solutes in a mechanism called cotransport. A substance that has been pumped across a membrane can do work as it moves back across the membrane by diffusion, analogous to water that has been pumped uphill and performs work as it flows back down. Another transport protein, a cotransporter separate from the pump, can couple the "downhill" diffusion of this substance to the "uphill" transport of a second substance against its own concentration (or electrochemical) gradient. For example, a plant cell uses the gradient of H+ generated by its proton pumps to drive the active transport of amino acids, sugars, and several other nutrients into the cell. One transport protein couples the return of H+ to the transport of sucrose into the cell (Figure 7.21). This protein can translocate sucrose into the cell against a concentration gradient, but only if the sucrose molecule travels 
in the company of a hydrogen ion. The hydrogen ion uses the transport protein as an avenue to diffuse down the electrochemical gradient maintained by the proton pump. Plants use sucrose-H+ cotransport to load sucrose produced by photosynthesis into cells in the veins of leaves.</justification>

These gradients combine in the electrochemical gradient, which determines the net direction of ionic diffusion. Electrogenic pumps, such as the sodium-potassium pump and proton pumps, are transport proteins that contribute to electrochemical gradients.

The ability of phospholipids to form membranes is inherent in their molecular structure. A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule, meaning it has both a hydrophilic region and a hydrophobic region (see Figure 5.12). Other types of membrane lipids are also amphipathic. Furthermore, most of the proteins within membranes have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. How are phospholipids and proteins arranged in the membranes of cells? In the fluid mosaic model, the membrane is a fluid structure with a "mosaic" of various proteins embedded in or attached to a double layer (bilayer) of phospholipids.

Ten years later, two Dutch scientists reasoned that cell membranes must be phospholipid bilayers.

        <justification>Taking these observations into account, S. J. Singer and G. Nicolson proposed in 1972 that membrane proteins reside in the phospholipid bilayer with their hydrophilic regions protruding (Figure 7.3). This molecular arrangement would maximize contact of hydrophilic regions of proteins and phospholipids with water in the cytosol and extracellular fluid, while providing their hydrophobic parts with a nonaqueous environment. In this fluid mosaic model, the membrane is a mosaic of protein molecules bobbing in a fluid bilayer of phospholipids. A method of preparing cells for electron microscopy called freeze-fracture has demonstrated visually that proteins are indeed embedded in the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane (Figure 7.4). Freeze-fracture splits a membrane along the middle of the bilayer, somewhat like pulling apart a chunky peanut butter sandwich. When the membrane layers are viewed in the electron microscope, the interior of the bilayer appears cobblestoned, with protein 
particles interspersed in a smooth matrix, in agreement with the fluid mosaic model. Some proteins remain attached to one layer or the other, like the peanut chunks in the sandwich. Figure 7.4 Research Method Freeze-fracture Application A cell membrane can be split into its two layers, revealing the structure of the membrane's interior. Technique A cell is frozen and fractured with a knife. The fracture plane often follows the hydrophobic interior of a membrane, splitting the phospholipid bilayer into two separated layers. Each membrane protein goes wholly with one of the layers. Results These SEMs show membrane proteins (the "bumps") in the two layers, demonstrating that proteins are embedded in the phospholipid bilayer. Figure 7.5 Updated model of an animal cell's plasma membrane (cutaway view). Because models are hypotheses, replacing one model of membrane structure with another does not imply that the original model was worthless. The acceptance or rejection of a model depends on how well it fits 
observations and explains experimental results. New findings may make a model obsolete; even then, it may not be totally scrapped, but revised to incorporate the new observations. The fluid mosaic model is continually being refined. For example, groups of proteins are often found associated in long-lasting, specialized patches, where they carry out common functions. The lipids themselves appear to form defined regions as well. Also, the membrane may be much more packed with proteins than imagined in the classic fluid mosaic model: compare the updated model in Figure 7.5 with the original model in Figure 7.3.

        <justification>Figure 7.6 The movement of phospholipids. Membranes are not static sheets of molecules locked rigidly in place. A membrane is held together primarily by hydrophobic interactions, which are much weaker than covalent bonds (see Figure 5.20). Most of the lipids and some of the proteins can shift about laterally: that is, in the plane of the membrane, like partygoers elbowing their way through a crowded room (Figure 7.6). It is quite rare, however, for a molecule to flip-flop transversely across the membrane, switching from one phospholipid layer to the other; to do so, the hydrophilic part of the molecule must cross the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. The lateral movement of phospholipids within the membrane is rapid. Adjacent phospholipids switch positions about 107 times per second, which means that a phospholipid can travel about 2 microm: the length of many bacterial cells: in 1 second. Proteins are much larger than lipids and move more slowly, but some membrane proteins do 
drift, as shown in a classic experiment described in Figure 7.7, on the next page. And some membrane proteins seem to move in a highly directed manner, perhaps driven along cytoskeletal fibers by motor proteins connected to the membrane proteins' cytoplasmic regions. However, many other membrane proteins seem to be held immobile by their attachment to the cytoskeleton or to the extracellular matrix (see Figure 7.5). Figure 7.7 Inquiry Do membrane proteins move? Experiment Larry Frye and Michael Edidin, at Johns Hopkins University, labeled the plasma membrane proteins of a mouse cell and a human cell with two different markers and fused the cells. Using a microscope, they observed the markers on the hybrid cell. Results Conclusion The mixing of the mouse and human membrane proteins indicates that at least some membrane proteins move sideways within the plane of the plasma membrane. SOURCE L. D. Frye and M. Edidin, The rapid intermixing of cell surface antigens after formation of mouse-human heterokaryons, 
Journal of Cell Science 7:319 (1970). Suppose the proteins did not mix in the hybrid cell, even many hours after fusion. Would you be able to conclude that proteins don't move within the membrane? What other explanation could there be? A membrane remains fluid as temperature decreases until finally the phospholipids settle into a closely packed arrangement and the membrane solidifies, much as bacon grease forms lard when it cools. The temperature at which a membrane solidifies depends on the types of lipids it is made of. The membrane remains fluid to a lower temperature if it is rich in phospholipids with unsaturated hydrocarbon tails (see Figures 5.11 and 5.12). Because of kinks in the tails where double bonds are located, unsaturated hydrocarbon tails cannot pack together as closely as saturated hydrocarbon tails, and this makes the membrane more fluid (Figure 7.8a). Figure 7.8 Factors that affect membrane fluidity. The steroid cholesterol, which is wedged between phospholipid molecules in the plasma 
membranes of animal cells, has different effects on membrane fluidity at different temperatures (Figure 7.8b). At relatively high temperatures: at 37 degree C, the body temperature of humans, for example: cholesterol makes the membrane less fluid by restraining phospholipid movement. However, because cholesterol also hinders the close packing of phospholipids, it lowers the temperature required for the membrane to solidify. Thus, cholesterol can be thought of as a "fluidity buffer" for the membrane, resisting changes in membrane fluidity that can be caused by changes in temperature. Membranes must be fluid to work properly; they are usually about as fluid as salad oil. When a membrane solidifies, its permeability changes, and enzymatic proteins in the membrane may become inactive if their activity requires them to be able to move within the membrane. However, membranes that are too fluid cannot support protein function either. Therefore, extreme environments pose a challenge for life, resulting in 
evolutionary adaptations that include differences in membrane lipid composition.</justification>

        <justification>EVOLUTION Variations in the cell membrane lipid compositions of many species appear to be evolutionary adaptations that maintain the appropriate membrane fluidity under specific environmental conditions. For instance, fishes that live in extreme cold have membranes with a high proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbon tails, enabling their membranes to remain fluid (see Figure 7.8a). At the other extreme, some bacteria and archaea thrive at temperatures greater than 90 degree C (194 degree F) in thermal hot springs and geysers. Their membranes include unusual lipids that may prevent excessive fluidity at such high temperatures. The ability to change the lipid composition of cell membranes in response to changing temperatures has evolved in organisms that live where temperatures vary. In many plants that tolerate extreme cold, such as winter wheat, the percentage of unsaturated phospholipids increases in autumn, an adjustment that keeps the membranes from solidifying during winter. Certain 
bacteria and archaea can also change the proportion of unsaturated phospholipids in their cell membranes, depending on the temperature at which they are growing. Overall, natural selection has apparently favored organisms whose mix of membrane lipids ensures an appropriate level of membrane fluidity for their environment.</justification>

        <justification>Now we come to the mosaic aspect of the fluid mosaic model. Somewhat like a tile mosaic, a membrane is a collage of different proteins, often clustered together in groups, embedded in the fluid matrix of the lipid bilayer (see Figure 7.5). More than 50 kinds of proteins have been found so far in the plasma membrane of red blood cells, for example. Phospholipids form the main fabric of the membrane, but proteins determine most of the membrane's functions. Different types of cells contain different sets of membrane proteins, and the various membranes within a cell each have a unique collection of proteins. Figure 7.9 The structure of a transmembrane protein. Bacteriorhodopsin (a bacterial transport protein) has a distinct orientation in the membrane, with its N-terminus outside the cell and its C-terminus inside. This ribbon model highlights the ?-helical secondary structure of the hydrophobic parts, which lie mostly within the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. The protein includes 
seven transmembrane helices. The nonhelical hydrophilic segments are in contact with the aqueous solutions on the extracellular and cytoplasmic sides of the membrane. Notice in Figure 7.5 that there are two major populations of membrane proteins: integral proteins and peripheral proteins. Integral proteins penetrate the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer. The majority are transmembrane proteins, which span the membrane; other integral proteins extend only partway into the hydrophobic interior. The hydrophobic regions of an integral protein consist of one or more stretches of nonpolar amino acids (see Figure 5.16), usually coiled into ? helices (Figure 7.9). The hydrophilic parts of the molecule are exposed to the aqueous solutions on either side of the membrane. Some proteins also have a hydrophilic channel through their center that allows passage of hydrophilic substances (see Figure 7.1). Peripheral proteins are not embedded in the lipid bilayer at all; they are appendages loosely bound to the 
surface of the membrane, often to exposed parts of integral proteins (see Figure 7.5). On the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, some membrane proteins are held in place by attachment to the cytoskeleton. And on the extracellular side, certain membrane proteins are attached to fibers of the extracellular matrix (see Figure 6.30; integrins are one type of integral protein). These attachments combine to give animal cells a stronger framework than the plasma membrane alone could provide. Figure 7.10 Some functions of membrane proteins. In many cases, a single protein performs multiple tasks. Figure 7.10 gives an overview of six major functions performed by proteins of the plasma membrane. A single cell may have membrane proteins carrying out several of these functions, and a single membrane protein may have multiple functions.

        <justification>One of the first clues to the mechanism of photosynthesis came from the discovery that the O2 given off by plants is derived from H2O and not from CO2. The chloroplast splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. Before this discovery, the prevailing hypothesis was that photosynthesis split carbon dioxide (CO2 &amp;rarr; C + O2) and then added water to the carbon (C + H2O &amp;rarr; [CH2O]). This hypothesis predicted that the O2 released during photosynthesis came from CO2. This idea was challenged in the 1930s by C. B. van Niel, of Stanford University. Van Niel was investigating photosynthesis in bacteria that make their carbohydrate from CO2 but do not release O2. He concluded that, at least in these bacteria, CO2 is not split into carbon and oxygen. One group of bacteria used hydrogen sulfide (H2S) rather than water for photosynthesis, forming yellow globules of sulfur as a waste product (these globules are visible in Figure 10.2e). Here is the chemical equation for photosynthesis in 
these sulfur bacteria: CO2 + 2 H2S &amp;rarr; [CH2O] + H2 + 2 S Van Niel reasoned that the bacteria split H2S and used the hydrogen atoms to make sugar. He then generalized that idea, proposing that all photosynthetic organisms require a hydrogen source but that the source varies:</justification>

        <justification>The cells of plants, prokaryotes, fungi, and some protists are surrounded by walls (see Figure 6.28). When such a cell is immersed in a hypotonic solution: bathed in rainwater, for example: the wall helps maintain the cell's water balance. Consider a plant cell. Like an animal cell, the plant cell swells as water enters by osmosis (Figure 7.15b). However, the relatively inelastic wall will expand only so much before it exerts a back pressure on the cell, called turgor pressure, that opposes further water uptake. At this point, the cell is turgid (very firm), which is the healthy state for most plant cells. Plants that are not woody, such as most houseplants, depend for mechanical support on cells kept turgid by a surrounding hypotonic solution. If a plant's cells and their surroundings are isotonic, there is no net tendency for water to enter, and the cells become flaccid (limp). However, a wall is of no advantage if the cell is immersed in a hypertonic environment. In this case, a 
plant cell, like an animal cell, will lose water to its surroundings and shrink. As the plant cell shrivels, its plasma membrane pulls away from the wall. This phenomenon, called plasmolysis, causes the plant to wilt and can lead to plant death. The walled cells of bacteria and fungi also plasmolyze in hypertonic environments.</justification>

        <justification>When guard cells take in water from neighboring cells by osmosis, they become more turgid. In most angiosperm species, the cell walls of guard cells are uneven in thickness, and the cellulose microfibrils are oriented in a direction that causes the guard cells to bow outward when turgid (Figure 36.15a). This bowing outward increases the size of the pore between the guard cells. When the cells lose water and become flaccid, they become less bowed, and the pore closes. The changes in turgor pressure in guard cells result primarily from the reversible absorption and loss of K+. Stomata open when guard cells actively accumulate K+ from neighboring epidermal cells (Figure 36.15b). The flow of K+ across the plasma membrane of the guard cell is coupled to the generation of a membrane potential by proton pumps (see Figure 36.7a). Stomatal opening correlates with active transport of H+ out of the guard cell. The resulting voltage (membrane potential) drives K+ into the cell through specific 
membrane channels. The absorption of K+ causes the water potential to become more negative within the guard cells, and the cells become more turgid as water enters by osmosis. Because most of the K+ and water are stored in the vacuole, the vacuolar membrane also plays a role in regulating guard cell dynamics. Stomatal closing results from a loss of K+ from guard cells to neighboring cells, which leads to an osmotic loss of water. Aquaporins also help regulate the osmotic swelling and shrinking of guard cells.</justification>

When the plant has a water deficiency, guard cells may lose turgor and close stomata. In addition, a hormone called abscisic acid (ABA), produced in roots and leaves in response to water deficiency, signals guard cells to close stomata.

Thus, a plant's tremendous requirement for water is largely a consequence of the shoot system's need for ample exchange of CO2 and O2 for photosynthesis. By opening and closing the stomata, guard cells help balance the plant's requirement to conserve water with its requirement for photosynthesis (Figure 36.14).</justification>

The waxy cuticle limits water loss through the remaining surface of the leaf. Each stoma is flanked by a pair of guard cells. Guard cells control the diameter of the stoma by changing shape, thereby widening or narrowing the gap between the guard cell pair.

        <justification>ABA plays a major role in drought signaling. When a plant begins to wilt, ABA accumulates in the leaves and causes stomata to close rapidly, reducing transpiration and preventing further water loss. By affecting second messengers such as calcium, ABA causes potassium channels in the plasma membrane of guard cells to open, leading to a massive loss of potassium ions from the cells. The accompanying osmotic loss of water reduces guard cell turgor and leads to closing of the stomatal pores (see Figure 36.15). In some cases, water shortage stresses the root system before the shoot system, and ABA transported from roots to leaves may function as an "early warning system.</justification>

        <justification>But plants have control systems that enable them to cope with less extreme water deficits. Many of a plant's responses to water deficit help the plant conserve water by reducing the rate of transpiration. Water deficit in a leaf causes guard cells to lose turgor, a simple control mechanism that slows transpiration by closing stomata (see Figure 36.15). Water deficit also stimulates increased synthesis and release of abscisic acid in the leaf; this hormone helps keep stomata closed by acting on guard cell membranes. Leaves respond to water deficit in several other ways. For example, when the leaves of grasses wilt, they roll into a tubelike shape that reduces transpiration by exposing less leaf surface to dry air and wind. Other plants, such as ocotillo (see Figure 36.16), shed their leaves in response to seasonal drought. Although these leaf responses conserve water, they also reduce photosynthesis, which is one reason why a drought diminishes crop yield.</justification>

    <text>How is an electron transport chain related to mitochondria?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Cellular respiration also brings hydrogen and oxygen together to form water, but there are two important differences. First, in cellular respiration, the hydrogen that reacts with oxygen is derived from organic molecules rather than H2. Second, instead of occurring in one explosive reaction, respiration uses an electron transport chain to break the fall of electrons to oxygen into several energy-releasing steps (Figure 9.5b). An electron transport chain consists of a number of molecules, mostly proteins, built into the inner membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and the plasma membrane of aerobically respiring prokaryotes. Electrons removed from glucose are shuttled by NADH to the "top," higher-energy end of the chain. At the "bottom," lower-energy end, O2 captures these electrons along with hydrogen nuclei (H+), forming water. Electron transfer from NADH to oxygen is an exergonic reaction with a free-energy change of -'53 kcal/mol (-'222 kJ/mol). Instead of this energy 
being released and wasted in a single explosive step, electrons cascade down the chain from one carrier molecule to the next in a series of redox reactions, losing a small amount of energy with each step until they finally reach oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor, which has a very great affinity for electrons.</justification>

The gold arrows trace the transport of electrons, which finally pass to oxygen at the "downhill" end of the chain, forming water. As Figure 9.13 showed, most of the electron carriers of the chain are grouped into four complexes. Two mobile carriers, ubiquinone (Q) and cytochrome c (Cyt c), move rapidly, ferrying electrons between the large complexes. As complexes I, III, and IV accept and then donate electrons, they pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. (In prokaryotes, protons are pumped outside the plasma membrane. ) Note that FADH2 deposits its electrons via complex II and so results in fewer protons being pumped into the intermembrane space than occurs with NADH. Chemical 
energy originally harvested from food is transformed into a proton-motive force, a gradient of H+ across the membrane. &amp;#x278B; During chemiosmosis, the protons flow back down their gradient via ATP synthase, which is built into the membrane nearby. The ATP synthase harnesses the proton-motive force to phosphorylate ADP, forming ATP. Together, electron transport and chemiosmosis make up oxidative phosphorylation. How does the inner mitochondrial membrane or the prokaryotic plasma membrane generate and maintain the H+ gradient that drives ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase protein complex? Establishing the H+ gradient is a major function of the electron transport chain, which is shown in its mitochondrial location in Figure 9.15. The chain is an energy converter that uses the exergonic flow of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to pump H+ across the membrane, from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. The H+ has a tendency to move back across the membrane, diffusing down its gradient. And the 
ATP synthases are the only sites that provide a route through the membrane for H+. As we described previously, the passage of H+ through ATP synthase uses the exergonic flow of H+ to drive the phosphorylation of ADP. Thus, the energy stored in an H+ gradient across a membrane couples the redox reactions of the electron transport chain to ATP synthesis, an example of chemiosmosis.</justification>

In eukaryotic cells, the electron carriers are spatially arranged in the inner mitochondrial membrane in such a way that H+ is accepted from the mitochondrial matrix and deposited in the intermembrane space (see Figure 9.15). The H+ gradient that results is referred to as a proton-motive force, emphasizing the capacity of the gradient to perform work.

Figure 7.11 Impact Blocking HIV Entry into Cells as a Treatment for HIV Infections Despite multiple exposures to HIV, a small number of people do not develop AIDS and show no evidence of HIV-infected cells. Comparing their genes with the genes of infected individuals, researchers discovered that resistant individuals have an unusual form of a gene that codes for an immune cell-surface protein called CCR5. Further work showed that HIV binds to a main protein receptor (CD4) on an immune cell, but most types of HIV also 
need to bind to CCR5 as a "co-receptor" to actually infect the cell (below, left). An absence of CCR5 on the cells of resistant individuals, due to the gene alteration, prevents the virus from entering the cells (below, right).</justification>

        <justification>Figure 8.11 The ATP cycle. Energy released by breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell is used to phosphorylate ADP, regenerating ATP. Chemical potential energy stored in ATP drives most cellular work. An organism at work uses ATP continuously, but ATP is a renewable resource that can be regenerated by the addition of phosphate to ADP (Figure 8.11). The free energy required to phosphorylate ADP comes from exergonic breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell. This shuttling of inorganic phosphate and energy is called the ATP cycle, and it couples the cell's energy-yielding (exergonic) processes to the energy-consuming (endergonic) ones. The ATP cycle proceeds at an astonishing pace. For example, a working muscle cell recycles its entire pool of ATP in less than a minute. That turnover represents 10 million molecules of ATP consumed and regenerated per second per cell. If ATP could not be regenerated by the phosphorylation of ADP, humans would use up nearly their body weight in ATP 
each day. Because both directions of a reversible process cannot be downhill, the regeneration of ATP from ADP and &amp;#9413;i is necessarily endergonic: ADP + &amp;#9413;i &amp;rarr; ATP + H2O &amp;Delta;G = +7.3 kcal/mol (+30.5 kJ/mol) (standard conditions) Since ATP formation from ADP and &amp;#9413;i is not spontaneous, free energy must be spent to make it occur. Catabolic (exergonic) pathways, especially cellular respiration, provide the energy for the endergonic process of making ATP. Plants also use light energy to produce ATP. Thus, the ATP cycle is a revolving door through which energy passes during its transfer from catabolic to anabolic pathways.</justification>

        <justification>The C4 plants are so named because they preface the Calvin cycle with an alternate mode of carbon fixation that forms a four-carbon compound as its first product. Several thousand species in at least 19 plant families use the C4 pathway. Among the C4 plants important to agriculture are sugarcane and corn, members of the grass family. Figure 10.20 C4 leaf anatomy and the C4 pathway. The structure and biochemical functions of the leaves of C4 plants are an evolutionary adaptation to hot, dry climates. This adaptation maintains a CO2 concentration in the bundle sheath that favors photosynthesis over photorespiration. A unique leaf anatomy is correlated with the mechanism of C4 photosynthesis (Figure 10.20; compare with Figure 10.4). In C4 plants, there are two distinct types of photosynthetic cells: bundle-sheath cells and mesophyll cells. Bundle-sheath cells are arranged into tightly packed sheaths around the veins of the leaf. Between the bundle sheath and the leaf surface are the more 
loosely arranged mesophyll cells. The Calvin cycle is confined to the chloroplasts of the bundle-sheath cells. However, the Calvin cycle is preceded by incorporation of CO2 into organic compounds in the mesophyll cells. See the numbered steps in Figure 10.20, which are also described here: The first step is carried out by an enzyme present only in mesophyll cells called PEP carboxylase. This enzyme adds CO2 to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), forming the four-carbon product oxaloacetate. PEP carboxylase has a much higher affinity for CO2 than does rubisco and no affinity for O2. Therefore, PEP carboxylase can fix carbon efficiently when rubisco cannot: that is, when it is hot and dry and stomata are partially closed, causing CO2 concentration in the leaf to fall and O2 concentration to rise. After the C4 plant fixes carbon from CO2, the mesophyll cells export their four-carbon products (malate in the example shown in Figure 10.20) to bundle-sheath cells through plasmodesmata (see Figure 6.31). Within the bundle-
sheath cells, the four-carbon compounds release CO2, which is reassimilated into organic material by rubisco and the Calvin cycle. The same reaction regenerates pyruvate, which is transported to mesophyll cells. There, ATP is used to convert pyruvate to PEP, allowing the reaction cycle to continue; this ATP can be thought of as the "price" of concentrating CO2 in the bundle-sheath cells. To generate this extra ATP, bundle-sheath cells carry out cyclic electron flow, the process described earlier in this chapter (see Figure 10.16). In fact, these cells contain PS I but no PS II, so cyclic electron flow is their only photosynthetic mode of generating ATP. In effect, the mesophyll cells of a C4 plant pump CO2 into the bundle sheath, keeping the CO2 concentration in the bundle-sheath cells high enough for rubisco to bind carbon dioxide rather than oxygen. The cyclic series of reactions involving PEP carboxylase and the regeneration of PEP can be thought of as a CO2-concentrating pump that is powered by ATP. In 
this way, C4 photosynthesis minimizes photorespiration and enhances sugar production. This adaptation is especially advantageous in hot regions with intense sunlight, where stomata partially close during the day, and it is in such environments that C4 plants evolved and thrive today.</justification>

Notice in Figure 10.21 that the CAM pathway is similar to the C4 pathway in that carbon dioxide is first incorporated into organic intermediates before it enters the Calvin cycle. The difference is that in C4 plants, the initial steps of carbon fixation are separated structurally from the Calvin cycle, whereas in CAM plants, the two steps occur at separate times but within the same cell.

This process consumes organic fuel and releases CO2 without producing ATP or carbohydrate. Photorespiration may be an evolutionary relic, and it may play a photoprotective role. C4 plants minimize the cost of photorespiration by incorporating CO2 into four-carbon compounds in mesophyll cells.

        <justification>Figure 8.19 Allosteric regulation of enzyme activity. Most enzymes known to be allosterically regulated are constructed from two or more subunits, each composed of a polypeptide chain with its own active site. The entire complex oscillates between two different shapes, one catalytically active and the other inactive (Figure 8.19a). In the simplest kind of allosteric regulation, an activating or inhibiting regulatory molecule binds to a regulatory site (sometimes called an allosteric site), often located where subunits join. The binding of an activator to a regulatory site stabilizes the shape that has functional active sites, whereas the binding of an inhibitor stabilizes the inactive form of the enzyme. The subunits of an allosteric enzyme fit together in such a way that a shape change in one subunit is transmitted to all others. Through this interaction of subunits, a single activator or inhibitor molecule that binds to one regulatory site will affect the active sites of all subunits.
 Fluctuating concentrations of regulators can cause a sophisticated pattern of response in the activity of cellular enzymes. The products of ATP hydrolysis (ADP and Pi), for example, play a complex role in balancing the flow of traffic between anabolic and catabolic pathways by their effects on key enzymes. ATP binds to several catabolic enzymes allosterically, lowering their affinity for substrate and thus inhibiting their activity. ADP, however, functions as an activator of the same enzymes. This is logical because catabolism functions in regenerating ATP. If ATP production lags behind its use, ADP accumulates and activates the enzymes that speed up catabolism, producing more ATP. If the supply of ATP exceeds demand, then catabolism slows down as ATP molecules accumulate and bind to the same enzymes, inhibiting them. (You'll see specific examples of this type of regulation when you learn about cellular respiration in the next chapter. ) ATP, ADP, and other related molecules also affect key enzymes in 
anabolic pathways. In this way, allosteric enzymes control the rates of important reactions in both sorts of metabolic pathways. In another kind of allosteric activation, a substrate molecule binding to one active site in a multisubunit enzyme triggers a shape change in all the subunits, thereby increasing catalytic activity at the other active sites (Figure 8.19b). Called cooperativity, this mechanism amplifies the response of enzymes to substrates: One substrate molecule primes an enzyme to act on additional substrate molecules more readily. Cooperativity is considered "allosteric" regulation because binding of the substrate to one active site affects catalysis in another active site. Although the vertebrate oxygen transport protein hemoglobin is not an enzyme, classic studies of cooperative binding in this protein have elucidated the principle of cooperativity. Hemoglobin is made up of four subunits, each of which has an oxygen-binding site (see Figure 5.20). The binding of an oxygen molecule to one 
binding site increases the affinity for oxygen of the remaining binding sites. Thus, where oxygen is at high levels, such as in the lungs or gills, hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases as more binding sites are filled. In oxygen-deprived tissues, however, the release of each oxygen molecule decreases the oxygen affinity of the other binding sites, resulting in the release of oxygen where it is most needed.

        <justification>When ATP allosterically inhibits an enzyme in an ATP-generating pathway, as we discussed earlier, the result is feedback inhibition, a common mode of metabolic control. In feedback inhibition, a metabolic pathway is switched off by the inhibitory binding of its end product to an enzyme that acts early in the pathway. Figure 8.21 shows an example of this control mechanism operating on an anabolic pathway. Certain cells use this five-step pathway to synthesize the amino acid isoleucine from threonine, another amino acid. As isoleucine accumulates, it slows down its own synthesis by allosterically inhibiting the enzyme for the first step of the pathway. Feedback inhibition thereby prevents the cell from wasting chemical resources by making more isoleucine than is necessary.</justification>

    <text>How does the human body deal with a buildup of lactate as a product of lactic acid fermentation?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>During lactic acid fermentation (Figure 9.17b), pyruvate is reduced directly by NADH to form lactate as an end product, with no release of CO2. (Lactate is the ionized form of lactic acid. ) Lactic acid fermentation by certain fungi and bacteria is used in the dairy industry to make cheese and yogurt. Human muscle cells make ATP by lactic acid fermentation when oxygen is scarce. This occurs during the early stages of strenuous exercise, when sugar catabolism for ATP production outpaces the muscle's supply of oxygen from the blood. Under these conditions, the cells switch from aerobic respiration to fermentation. The lactate that accumulates was previously thought to cause muscle fatigue and pain, but recent research suggests instead that increased levels of potassium ions (K+) may be to blame, while lactate appears to enhance muscle performance. In any case, the excess lactate is gradually carried away by the blood to the liver, where it is converted back to pyruvate by liver cells.</justification>

        <justification>Electrons lose very little of their potential energy when they are transferred from glucose to NAD+. Each NADH molecule formed during respiration represents stored energy that can be tapped to make ATP when the electrons complete their "fall" down an energy gradient from NADH to oxygen. Figure 9.5 An introduction to electron transport chains. (a) The one-step exergonic reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to form water releases a large amount of energy in the form of heat and light: an explosion. (b) In cellular respiration, the same reaction occurs in stages: An electron transport chain breaks the "fall" of electrons in this reaction into a series of smaller steps and stores some of the released energy in a form that can be used to make ATP. (The rest of the energy is released as heat. ) How do electrons that are extracted from glucose and stored as potential energy in NADH finally reach oxygen? It will help to compare the redox chemistry of cellular respiration to a much simpler reaction:
 the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water (Figure 9.5a). Mix H2 and O2, provide a spark for activation energy, and the gases combine explosively. In fact, combustion of liquid H2 and O2 is harnessed to power the main engines of the space shuttle after it is launched, boosting it into orbit. The explosion represents a release of energy as the electrons of hydrogen "fall" closer to the electronegative oxygen atoms. Cellular respiration also brings hydrogen and oxygen together to form water, but there are two important differences. First, in cellular respiration, the hydrogen that reacts with oxygen is derived from organic molecules rather than H2. Second, instead of occurring in one explosive reaction, respiration uses an electron transport chain to break the fall of electrons to oxygen into several energy-releasing steps (Figure 9.5b). An electron transport chain consists of a number of molecules, mostly proteins, built into the inner membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and the 
plasma membrane of aerobically respiring prokaryotes. Electrons removed from glucose are shuttled by NADH to the "top," higher-energy end of the chain. At the "bottom," lower-energy end, O2 captures these electrons along with hydrogen nuclei (H+), forming water. Electron transfer from NADH to oxygen is an exergonic reaction with a free-energy change of -'53 kcal/mol (-'222 kJ/mol). Instead of this energy being released and wasted in a single explosive step, electrons cascade down the chain from one carrier molecule to the next in a series of redox reactions, losing a small amount of energy with each step until they finally reach oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor, which has a very great affinity for electrons. Each "downhill" carrier is more electronegative than, and thus capable of oxidizing, its "uphill" neighbor, with oxygen at the bottom of the chain. Therefore, the electrons removed from glucose by NAD+ fall down an energy gradient in the electron transport chain to a far more stable location in the 
electronegative oxygen atom. Put another way, oxygen pulls electrons down the chain in an energy-yielding tumble analogous to gravity pulling objects downhill. In summary, during cellular respiration, most electrons travel the following "downhill" route: glucose&amp;rarr; NADH&amp;rarr; electron transport chain&amp;rarr; oxygen.</justification>

        <justification>Now let's take a closer look at the electron transport chain in Figure 9.13. We'll first describe the passage of electrons through complex I in some detail, as an illustration of the general principles involved in electron transport. Electrons removed from glucose by NAD+, during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, are transferred from NADH to the first molecule of the electron transport chain in complex I. This molecule is a flavoprotein, so named because it has a prosthetic group called flavin mononucleotide (FMN). In the next redox reaction, the flavoprotein returns to its oxidized form as it passes electrons to an iron-sulfur protein (Fe. S in complex I), one of a family of proteins with both iron and sulfur tightly bound. The iron-sulfur protein then passes the electrons to a compound called ubiquinone (Q in Figure 9.13). This electron carrier is a small hydrophobic molecule, the only member of the electron transport chain that is not a protein. Ubiquinone is individually mobile 
within the membrane rather than residing in a particular complex. (Another name for ubiquinone is coenzyme Q, or CoQ; you may have seen it sold as a nutritional supplement. ) Most of the remaining electron carriers between ubiquinone and oxygen are proteins called cytochromes. Their prosthetic group, called a heme group, has an iron atom that accepts and donates electrons. (It is similar to the heme group in hemoglobin, the protein of red blood cells, except that the iron in hemoglobin carries oxygen, not electrons. ) The electron transport chain has several types of cytochromes, each a different protein with a slightly different electron-carrying heme group. The last cytochrome of the chain, cyt a3, passes its electrons to oxygen, which is very electronegative. Each oxygen atom also picks up a pair of hydrogen ions from the aqueous solution, forming water. Another source of electrons for the transport chain is FADH2, the other reduced product of the citric acid cycle. Notice in Figure 9.13 that FADH2 adds 
its electrons to the electron transport chain from within complex II, at a lower energy level than NADH does. Consequently, although NADH and FADH2 each donate an equivalent number of electrons (2) for oxygen reduction, the electron transport chain provides about one-third less energy for ATP synthesis when the electron donor is FADH2 rather than NADH.</justification>

        <justification>Fermentation, anaerobic respiration, and aerobic respiration are three alternative cellular pathways for producing ATP by harvesting the chemical energy of food. All three use glycolysis to oxidize glucose and other organic fuels to pyruvate, with a net production of 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. And in all three pathways, NAD+ is the oxidizing agent that accepts electrons from food during glycolysis. A key difference among the three pathways is the contrasting mechanisms for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which is required to sustain glycolysis. In fermentation, the final electron acceptor is an organic molecule such as pyruvate (lactic acid fermentation) or acetaldehyde (alcohol fermentation). In cellular respiration, by contrast, electrons carried by NADH are transferred to an electron transport chain, where they move stepwise down a series of redox reactions to a final electron acceptor. In aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is oxygen; in anaerobic 
respiration, the final acceptor is another molecule that is electronegative (although invariably less so than oxygen).</justification>

        <justification>Diffusion of K+ through open potassium channels is critical for formation of the resting potential. The K+ concentration is 140 mM inside the cell, but only 5 mM outside. The chemical concentration gradient thus favors a net outflow of K+. Furthermore, a resting neuron has many open potassium channels, but very few open sodium channels (see Figure 48.7). Because Na+ and other ions can't readily cross the membrane, K+ outflow leads to a net negative charge inside the cell. This buildup of negative charge within the neuron is the major source of the membrane potential. What stops the buildup of negative charge? The excess negative charges inside the cell exert an attractive force that opposes the flow of additional positively charged potassium ions out of the cell.

        <justification>All cells have voltages across their plasma membranes. Voltage is electrical potential energy: a separation of opposite charges. The cytoplasmic side of the membrane is negative in charge relative to the extracellular side because of an unequal distribution of anions and cations on the two sides. The voltage across a membrane, called a membrane potential, ranges from about -'50 to -'200 millivolts (mV). (The minus sign indicates that the inside of the cell is negative relative to the outside. ) The membrane potential acts like a battery, an energy source that affects the traffic of all charged substances across the membrane. Because the inside of the cell is negative compared with the outside, the membrane potential favors the passive transport of cations into the cell and anions out of the cell. Thus, two forces drive the diffusion of ions across a membrane: a chemical force (the ion's concentration gradient) and an electrical force (the effect of the membrane potential on the ion's 
movement). This combination of forces acting on an ion is called the electrochemical gradient.</justification>

The voltage and H+ concentration gradient represent a dual energy source that can drive other processes, such as the uptake of nutrients. Most proton pumps are powered by ATP. Some membrane proteins that actively transport ions contribute to the membrane potential. An example is the sodium-potassium pump. Notice in Figure 7.18 that the pump does not translocate Na+ and K+ one for one, but pumps three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions it pumps into the cell. With each "crank" of the pump, there is a net transfer of one positive charge from the cytoplasm to the extracellular fluid, a process that stores energy as voltage. A transport protein that generates voltage across a membrane is called an electrogenic pump. The sodium-potassium pump appears to be 
the major electrogenic pump of animal cells. The main electrogenic pump of plants, fungi, and bacteria is a proton pump, which actively transports protons (hydrogen ions, H+) out of the cell.

The flow of K+ across the plasma membrane of the guard cell is coupled to the generation of a membrane potential by proton pumps (see Figure 36.7a). Stomatal opening correlates with active transport of H+ out of the guard cell. The resulting voltage (membrane potential) drives K+ into the cell through specific membrane channels.

        <justification>A sodium-potassium pump transports three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions that it transports in. Although this pumping generates a net export of positive charge, the resulting voltage difference is only a few millivolts. Why, then, is there a voltage difference of 60-80 mV in a resting neuron? The answer lies in ion movement through ion channels, pores formed by clusters of specialized proteins that span the membrane. Ion channels allow ions to diffuse back and forth across the membrane. As ions diffuse through channels, they carry with them units of electrical charge. Any resulting net movement of positive or negative charge will generate a membrane potential, or voltage across the membrane. The concentration gradients of K+ and Na+ across the plasma membrane represent a chemical form of potential energy. The ion channels that convert this chemical potential energy to electrical potential energy can do so because they have selective permeability, allowing only 
certain ions to pass. For example, a potassium channel allows K+ to diffuse freely across the membrane, but not other ions, such as Na+. Diffusion of K+ through open potassium channels is critical for formation of the resting potential. The K+ concentration is 140 mM inside the cell, but only 5 mM outside. The chemical concentration gradient thus favors a net outflow of K+. Furthermore, a resting neuron has many open potassium channels, but very few open sodium channels (see Figure 48.7).

Figure 8.9 How ATP drives chemical work: Energy coupling using ATP hydrolysis. In this example, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis is used to drive an endergonic process: the cellular synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid and ammonia. For example, with the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to use the energy released by ATP hydrolysis directly to drive chemical reactions that, by themselves, are endergonic. If the deltaG of an endergonic reaction is less than the amount of energy released by ATP hydrolysis, then the two reactions can be coupled so that, overall, the coupled reactions are exergonic (Figure 8.9). This usually involves the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to some other molecule, such as the reactant. The recipient with the phosphate group covalently bonded to 
it is then called a phosphorylated intermediate. The key to coupling exergonic and endergonic reactions is the formation of this phosphorylated intermediate, which is more reactive (less stable) than the original unphosphorylated molecule.</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>In another kind of allosteric activation, a substrate molecule binding to one active site in a multisubunit enzyme triggers a shape change in all the subunits, thereby increasing catalytic activity at the other active sites (Figure 8.19b). Called cooperativity, this mechanism amplifies the response of enzymes to substrates: One substrate molecule primes an enzyme to act on additional substrate molecules more readily. Cooperativity is considered "allosteric" regulation because binding of the substrate to one active site affects catalysis in another active site. Although the vertebrate oxygen transport protein hemoglobin is not an enzyme, classic studies of cooperative binding in this protein have elucidated the principle of cooperativity. Hemoglobin is made up of four subunits, each of which has an oxygen-binding site (see Figure 5.20). The binding of an oxygen molecule to one binding site increases the affinity for oxygen of the remaining binding sites. Thus, where oxygen is at high 
levels, such as in the lungs or gills, hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases as more binding sites are filled. In oxygen-deprived tissues, however, the release of each oxygen molecule decreases the oxygen affinity of the other binding sites, resulting in the release of oxygen where it is most needed. Cooperativity works similarly in multisubunit enzymes that have been studied.</justification>

Like all respiratory pigments, hemoglobin binds O2 reversibly, loading O2 in the lungs or gills and unloading it in other parts of the body. This process depends on cooperativity between the hemoglobin subunits (see pp. 158-159). When O2 binds to one subunit, the others change shape slightly, increasing their affinity for O2. When four O2 molecules are bound and one subunit unloads its O2, the other three subunits more readily unload O2, as an associated shape change lowers their affinity for O2.

    <text>How do spontaneous processes relate to entropy?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>A logical consequence of the loss of usable energy during energy transfer or transformation is that each such event makes the universe more disordered. Scientists use a quantity called entropy as a measure of disorder, or randomness. The more randomly arranged a collection of matter is, the greater its entropy. We can now state the second law of thermodynamics: Every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe. Although order can increase locally, there is an unstoppable trend toward randomization of the universe as a whole. In many cases, increased entropy is evident in the physical disintegration of a system's organized structure. For example, you can observe increasing entropy in the gradual decay of an unmaintained building. Much of the increasing entropy of the universe is less apparent, however, because it appears as increasing amounts of heat and less ordered forms of matter. As the bear in Figure 8.3b converts chemical energy to kinetic energy, it is 
also increasing the disorder of its surroundings by producing heat and small molecules, such as the CO2 it exhales, that are the breakdown products of food. The concept of entropy helps us understand why certain processes occur without any input of energy. It turns out that for a process to occur on its own, without outside help, it must increase the entropy of the universe. A process that can occur without an input of energy is called a spontaneous process. Note that as we're using it here, the word spontaneous does not imply that such a process would occur quickly; rather, the word signifies that the process is energetically favorable. (In fact, it may be helpful for you to think of the phrase "energetically favorable" when you read the formal term "spontaneous. ") Some spontaneous processes, such as an explosion, may be virtually instantaneous, while others, such as the rusting of an old car over time, are much slower. A process that cannot occur on its own is said to be nonspontaneous; it will happen 
only if energy is added to the system. We know from experience that certain events occur spontaneously and others do not. For instance, we know that water flows downhill spontaneously but moves uphill only with an input of energy, such as when a machine pumps the water against gravity. This understanding gives us another way to state the second law: For a process to occur spontaneously, it must increase the entropy of the universe.</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>How does NAD+ trap electrons from glucose and other organic molecules? Enzymes called dehydrogenases remove a pair of hydrogen atoms (2 electrons and 2 protons) from the substrate (glucose, in this example), thereby oxidizing it. The enzyme delivers the 2 electrons along with 1 proton to its coenzyme, NAD+ (Figure 9.4). The other proton is released as a hydrogen ion (H+) into the surrounding solution: By receiving 2 negatively charged electrons but only 1 positively charged proton, NAD+ has its charge neutralized when it is reduced to NADH. The name NADH shows the hydrogen that has been received in the reaction. NAD+ is the most versatile electron acceptor in cellular respiration and functions in several of the redox steps during the breakdown of glucose. Electrons lose very little of their potential energy when they are transferred from glucose to NAD+. Each NADH molecule formed during respiration represents stored energy that can be tapped to make ATP when the electrons complete 
their "fall" down an energy gradient from NADH to oxygen. Figure 9.5 An introduction to electron transport chains. (a) The one-step exergonic reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to form water releases a large amount of energy in the form of heat and light: an explosion. (b) In cellular respiration, the same reaction occurs in stages: An electron transport chain breaks the "fall" of electrons in this reaction into a series of smaller steps and stores some of the released energy in a form that can be used to make ATP. (The rest of the energy is released as heat. ) How do electrons that are extracted from glucose and stored as potential energy in NADH finally reach oxygen? It will help to compare the redox chemistry of cellular respiration to a much simpler reaction: the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water (Figure 9.5a). Mix H2 and O2, provide a spark for activation energy, and the gases combine explosively. In fact, combustion of liquid H2 and O2 is harnessed to power the main engines of the space 
shuttle after it is launched, boosting it into orbit. The explosion represents a release of energy as the electrons of hydrogen "fall" closer to the electronegative oxygen atoms. Cellular respiration also brings hydrogen and oxygen together to form water, but there are two important differences. First, in cellular respiration, the hydrogen that reacts with oxygen is derived from organic molecules rather than H2. Second, instead of occurring in one explosive reaction, respiration uses an electron transport chain to break the fall of electrons to oxygen into several energy-releasing steps (Figure 9.5b). An electron transport chain consists of a number of molecules, mostly proteins, built into the inner membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and the plasma membrane of aerobically respiring prokaryotes. Electrons removed from glucose are shuttled by NADH to the "top," higher-energy end of the chain. At the "bottom," lower-energy end, O2 captures these electrons along with hydrogen nuclei (H+), forming 
water. Electron transfer from NADH to oxygen is an exergonic reaction with a free-energy change of -'53 kcal/mol (-'222 kJ/mol). Instead of this energy being released and wasted in a single explosive step, electrons cascade down the chain from one carrier molecule to the next in a series of redox reactions, losing a small amount of energy with each step until they finally reach oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor, which has a very great affinity for electrons. Each "downhill" carrier is more electronegative than, and thus capable of oxidizing, its "uphill" neighbor, with oxygen at the bottom of the chain. Therefore, the electrons removed from glucose by NAD+ fall down an energy gradient in the electron transport chain to a far more stable location in the electronegative oxygen atom. Put another way, oxygen pulls electrons down the chain in an energy-yielding tumble analogous to gravity pulling objects downhill. In summary, during cellular respiration, most electrons travel the following "downhill" route: 
glucose&amp;rarr; NADH&amp;rarr; electron transport chain&amp;rarr; oxygen.</justification>

        <justification>Some of the steps of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are redox reactions in which dehydrogenases transfer electrons from substrates to NAD+, forming NADH. In the third stage of respiration, the electron transport chain accepts electrons from the breakdown products of the first two stages (most often via NADH) and passes these electrons from one molecule to another. At the end of the chain, the electrons are combined with molecular oxygen and hydrogen ions (H+), forming water (see Figure 9.5b). The energy released at each step of the chain is stored in a form the mitochondrion (or prokaryotic cell) can use to make ATP from ADP. This mode of ATP synthesis is called oxidative phosphorylation because it is powered by the redox reactions of the electron transport chain.</justification>

        <justification>The electron transport chain is a collection of molecules embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion in eukaryotic cells. (In prokaryotes, these molecules reside in the plasma membrane. ) The folding of the inner membrane to form cristae increases its surface area, providing space for thousands of copies of the chain in each mitochondrion. (Once again, we see that structure fits function. ) Most components of the chain are proteins, which exist in multiprotein complexes numbered I through IV. Tightly bound to these proteins are prosthetic groups, nonprotein components essential for the catalytic functions of certain enzymes. Figure 9.13 Free-energy change during electron transport. The overall energy drop (deltaG) for electrons traveling from NADH to oxygen is 53 kcal/mol, but this "fall" is broken up into a series of smaller steps by the electron transport chain. (An oxygen atom is represented here as 1/2 O2 to emphasize that the electron transport chain reduces molecular 
oxygen, O2, not individual oxygen atoms. ) Figure 9.13 shows the sequence of electron carriers in the electron transport chain and the drop in free energy as electrons travel down the chain. During electron transport along the chain, electron carriers alternate between reduced and oxidized states as they accept and donate electrons. Each component of the chain becomes reduced when it accepts electrons from its "uphill" neighbor, which has a lower affinity for electrons (is less electronegative). It then returns to its oxidized form as it passes electrons to its "downhill," more electronegative neighbor. Now let's take a closer look at the electron transport chain in Figure 9.13. We'll first describe the passage of electrons through complex I in some detail, as an illustration of the general principles involved in electron transport. Electrons removed from glucose by NAD+, during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, are transferred from NADH to the first molecule of the electron transport chain in complex I. 
This molecule is a flavoprotein, so named because it has a prosthetic group called flavin mononucleotide (FMN). In the next redox reaction, the flavoprotein returns to its oxidized form as it passes electrons to an iron-sulfur protein (Fe. S in complex I), one of a family of proteins with both iron and sulfur tightly bound. The iron-sulfur protein then passes the electrons to a compound called ubiquinone (Q in Figure 9.13). This electron carrier is a small hydrophobic molecule, the only member of the electron transport chain that is not a protein. Ubiquinone is individually mobile within the membrane rather than residing in a particular complex. (Another name for ubiquinone is coenzyme Q, or CoQ; you may have seen it sold as a nutritional supplement. ) Most of the remaining electron carriers between ubiquinone and oxygen are proteins called cytochromes. Their prosthetic group, called a heme group, has an iron atom that accepts and donates electrons. (It is similar to the heme group in hemoglobin, the protein 
of red blood cells, except that the iron in hemoglobin carries oxygen, not electrons. ) The electron transport chain has several types of cytochromes, each a different protein with a slightly different electron-carrying heme group. The last cytochrome of the chain, cyt a3, passes its electrons to oxygen, which is very electronegative. Each oxygen atom also picks up a pair of hydrogen ions from the aqueous solution, forming water. Another source of electrons for the transport chain is FADH2, the other reduced product of the citric acid cycle. Notice in Figure 9.13 that FADH2 adds its electrons to the electron transport chain from within complex II, at a lower energy level than NADH does. Consequently, although NADH and FADH2 each donate an equivalent number of electrons (2) for oxygen reduction, the electron transport chain provides about one-third less energy for ATP synthesis when the electron donor is FADH2 rather than NADH. We'll see why in the next section. The electron transport chain makes no ATP 
directly. Instead, it eases the fall of electrons from food to oxygen, breaking a large free-energy drop into a series of smaller steps that release energy in manageable amounts.</justification>

        <justification>Fermentation, anaerobic respiration, and aerobic respiration are three alternative cellular pathways for producing ATP by harvesting the chemical energy of food. All three use glycolysis to oxidize glucose and other organic fuels to pyruvate, with a net production of 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. And in all three pathways, NAD+ is the oxidizing agent that accepts electrons from food during glycolysis. A key difference among the three pathways is the contrasting mechanisms for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which is required to sustain glycolysis. In fermentation, the final electron acceptor is an organic molecule such as pyruvate (lactic acid fermentation) or acetaldehyde (alcohol fermentation). In cellular respiration, by contrast, electrons carried by NADH are transferred to an electron transport chain, where they move stepwise down a series of redox reactions to a final electron acceptor. In aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is oxygen; in anaerobic 
respiration, the final acceptor is another molecule that is electronegative (although invariably less so than oxygen). Passage of electrons from NADH to the electron transport chain not only regenerates the NAD+ required for glycolysis but pays an ATP bonus when the stepwise electron transport from this NADH to oxygen drives oxidative phosphorylation. An even bigger ATP payoff comes from the oxidation of pyruvate in the mitochondrion, which is unique to respiration. Without an electron transport chain, the energy still stored in pyruvate is unavailable to most cells. Thus, cellular respiration harvests much more energy from each sugar molecule than fermentation can. In fact, aerobic respiration yields up to 16 times as much ATP per glucose molecule as does fermentation: up to 32 molecules of ATP for respiration, compared with 2 molecules of ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation in fermentation.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Some transport proteins, called channel proteins, function by having a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or atomic ions use as a tunnel through the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, left). For example, the passage of water molecules through the membrane in certain cells is greatly facilitated by channel proteins known as aquaporins. Each aquaporin allows entry of up to 3 billion (3 * 109) water molecules per second, passing single file through its central channel, which fits ten at a time. Without aquaporins, only a tiny fraction of these water molecules would pass through the same area of the cell membrane in a second, so the channel protein brings about a tremendous increase in rate.</justification>

        <justification>As described earlier, the two types of transport proteins are channel proteins and carrier proteins. Channel proteins simply provide corridors that allow specific molecules or ions to cross the membrane (Figure 7.17a). The hydrophilic passageways provided by these proteins can allow water molecules or small ions to diffuse very quickly from one side of the membrane to the other. Aquaporins, the water channel proteins, facilitate the massive amounts of diffusion that occur in plant cells and in animal cells such as red blood cells (see Figure 7.15). Certain kidney cells also have a high number of aquaporins, allowing them to reclaim water from urine before it is excreted. If the kidneys did not perform this function, you would excrete about 180 L of urine per day: and have to drink an equal volume of water!</justification>

        <justification>A difference in water potential determines the direction of water movement across membranes, but how do water molecules actually cross the membranes? Water molecules are small enough to diffuse across the phospholipid bilayer, even though the bilayer's interior is hydrophobic. However, their movement across biological membranes is too rapid to be explained by unaided diffusion. The transport of water molecules across membranes is facilitated by transport proteins called aquaporins (see Chapter 7). These selective channels affect the rate at which water moves osmotically across the membrane. Aquaporin channel proteins are highly dynamic: Their permeability is decreased by increases in cytosolic Ca2+ or decreases in cytosolic pH.</justification>

The temperature at which a membrane solidifies depends on the types of lipids it is made of. The membrane remains fluid to a lower temperature if it is rich in phospholipids with unsaturated hydrocarbon tails (see Figures 5.11 and 5.12). Because of kinks in the tails where double bonds are located, unsaturated hydrocarbon tails cannot pack together as closely as saturated hydrocarbon tails, and this makes the membrane more fluid (Figure 7.8a).</justification>

    <text>How was the overall photosynthetic equation first discovered?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>One of the first clues to the mechanism of photosynthesis came from the discovery that the O2 given off by plants is derived from H2O and not from CO2. The chloroplast splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. Before this discovery, the prevailing hypothesis was that photosynthesis split carbon dioxide (CO2 &amp;rarr; C + O2) and then added water to the carbon (C + H2O &amp;rarr; [CH2O]). This hypothesis predicted that the O2 released during photosynthesis came from CO2. This idea was challenged in the 1930s by C. B. van Niel, of Stanford University. Van Niel was investigating photosynthesis in bacteria that make their carbohydrate from CO2 but do not release O2. He concluded that, at least in these bacteria, CO2 is not split into carbon and oxygen. One group of bacteria used hydrogen sulfide (H2S) rather than water for photosynthesis, forming yellow globules of sulfur as a waste product (these globules are visible in Figure 10.2e). Here is the chemical equation for photosynthesis in 
these sulfur bacteria: CO2 + 2 H2S &amp;rarr; [CH2O] + H2 + 2 S Van Niel reasoned that the bacteria split H2S and used the hydrogen atoms to make sugar. He then generalized that idea, proposing that all photosynthetic organisms require a hydrogen source but that the source varies: Sulfur bacteria: CO2 + 2 H2S &amp;rarr; [CH2O] + H2O + 2 S Plants: CO2 + 2 H2O &amp;rarr; [CH2O] + H2O + O2 General: CO2 + 2 H2X &amp;rarr; [CH2O] + H2O + 2 X Thus, van Niel hypothesized that plants split H2O as a source of electrons from hydrogen atoms, releasing O2 as a by-product. Nearly 20 years later, scientists confirmed van Niel's hypothesis by using oxygen-18 (18O), a heavy isotope, as a tracer to follow the fate of oxygen atoms during photosynthesis. The experiments showed that the O2 from plants was labeled with 18O only if water was the source of the tracer (experiment 1). If the 18O was introduced to the plant in the form of CO2, the label did not turn up in the released O2 (experiment 2). In the following summary, red 
denotes labeled atoms of oxygen (18O): Experiment 1: CO2 + 2 H2O &amp;rarr; [CH2O] + H2O + O2 Experiment 2: CO2 + 2 H2O &amp;rarr; [CH2O] + H2O + O2 Figure 10.5 Tracking atoms through photosynthesis. The atoms from CO2 are shown in magenta, and the atoms from H2O are shown in blue. A significant result of the shuffling of atoms during photosynthesis is the extraction of hydrogen from water and its incorporation into sugar. The waste product of photosynthesis, O2, is released to the atmosphere.</justification>
