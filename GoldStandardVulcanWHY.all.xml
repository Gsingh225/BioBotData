    <text>Why is it important for blood transfusions to not occur between individuals with different blood types?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>The carbohydrates on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane vary from species to species, among individuals of the same species, and even from one cell type to another in a single individual. The diversity of the molecules and their location on the cell's surface enable membrane carbohydrates to function as markers that distinguish one cell from another. For example, the four human blood types designated A, B, AB, and O reflect variation in the carbohydrate part of glycoproteins on the surface of red blood cells.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>To avoid a blood transfusion being recognized as foreign by the recipient's immune system, the ABO blood groups of the donor and recipient must be taken into account. As discussed in Chapter 14, red blood cells are designated as type A if they have the type A carbohydrate on their surface. Similarly, the type B carbohydrate is found on type B red blood cells; both A and B carbohydrates are found on type AB red blood cells; and neither carbohydrate is found on type O red blood cells (see Figure 14.11). To understand how ABO blood groups affect transfusions, let's consider the immune response of someone with type A blood. It turns out that certain bacteria normally present in the body have epitopes very similar to the A and B carbohydrates. By responding to the bacterial epitope similar to the B carbohydrate, a person with type A blood makes antibodies that will react with the type B carbohydrate. No antibodies are made against the bacterial epitope similar to the type A carbohydrate 
because lymphocytes reactive with the body's own molecules are inactivated or eliminated during development. If the person with type A blood receives a transfusion of type B blood, that person's anti-B antibodies cause an immediate and devastating transfusion reaction. The transfused red blood cells undergo lysis, which can lead to chills, fever, shock, and kidney malfunction. By the same token, anti-A antibodies in the donated type B blood will act against the recipient's type A red blood cells. Although such interactions prevent type O individuals from receiving transfusions of any other blood type, the recent discovery of enzymes that can cleave the A and B carbohydrates from red blood cells may eliminate this problem.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 14.11 Multiple alleles for the ABO blood groups. The four blood groups result from different combinations of three alleles. Only two alleles exist for the pea characters that Mendel studied, but most genes exist in more than two allelic forms. The ABO blood groups in humans, for instance, are determined by three alleles of a single gene: IA, IB, and i. A person's blood group (phenotype) may be one of four types: A, B, AB, or O. These letters refer to two carbohydrates: A and B: that may be found on the surface of red blood cells. A person's blood cells may have carbohydrate A (type A blood), carbohydrate B (type B), both (type AB), or neither (type O), as shown schematically in Figure 14.11. Matching compatible blood groups is critical for safe blood transfusions (see Chapter 43).</justification>

        <justification>The Hardy-Weinberg principle describes a hypothetical population that is not evolving. But in real populations, the allele and genotype frequencies often do change over time. Such changes can occur when at least one of the following five conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is not met: No mutations. The gene pool is modified if mutations alter alleles or if entire genes are deleted or duplicated. Random mating. If individuals mate preferentially within a subset of the population, such as their close relatives (inbreeding), random mixing of gametes does not occur, and genotype frequencies change.</justification>

        <justification>EVOLUTION A small population is vulnerable to inbreeding and genetic drift, which draw the population down an extinction vortex toward smaller and smaller population size until no individuals survive (Figure 56.12). A key factor driving the extinction vortex is the loss of the genetic variation that enables evolutionary responses to environmental change, such as the appearance of new strains of pathogens. Both inbreeding and genetic drift can cause a loss of genetic variation (see Chapter 23), and their effects become more harmful as a population shrinks. Inbreeding often reduces fitness because offspring are more likely to be homozygous for harmful recessive traits.</justification>

    <text>Why can steroids easily pass through cell membranes?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Steroid hormones, such as cortisol and ecdysteroid, are lipids that contain four fused carbon rings. All are derived from the steroid cholesterol (see Figure 5.14). Epinephrine and thyroxine are amine hormones, each synthesized from a single amino acid, either tyrosine or tryptophan. As Figure 45.5 indicates, hormones vary in their solubility in aqueous and lipid-rich environments. Polypeptides and most amine hormones are water-soluble. Being insoluble in lipids, these hormones cannot pass through the plasma membranes of cells. Instead, they bind to cell-surface receptors that relay information to the nucleus through intracellular pathways. In contrast, steroid hormones, as well as other largely nonpolar (hydrophobic) hormones, such as thyroxine, are lipid-soluble and can pass through cell membranes readily. Receptors for lipid-soluble hormones typically reside in the cytoplasm or nucleus.</justification>

        <justification>Intracellular receptor proteins are found in either the cytoplasm or nucleus of target cells. To reach such a receptor, a chemical messenger passes through the target cell's plasma membrane. A number of important signaling molecules can do this because they are either hydrophobic enough or small enough to cross the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. Such hydrophobic chemical messengers include the steroid hormones and thyroid hormones of animals.</justification>

    <text>Why is ATP considered a molecule with high potential energy?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Because their hydrolysis releases energy, the phosphate bonds of ATP are sometimes referred to as high-energy phosphate bonds, but the term is misleading. The phosphate bonds of ATP are not unusually strong bonds, as "high-energy" may imply; rather, the reactants (ATP and water) themselves have high energy relative to the energy of the products (ADP and &amp;#9413;i). The release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change to a state of lower free energy, not from the phosphate bonds themselves. ATP is useful to the cell because the energy it releases on losing a phosphate group is somewhat greater than the energy most other molecules could deliver. But why does this hydrolysis release so much energy? If we reexamine the ATP molecule in Figure 8.8a, we can see that all three phosphate groups are negatively charged. These like charges are crowded together, and their mutual repulsion contributes to the instability of this region of the ATP molecule. The 
triphosphate tail of ATP is the chemical equivalent of a compressed spring.</justification>

        <justification>The ability of sexual reproduction to generate genetic diversity is one of the most commonly proposed explanations for the evolutionary persistence of this process. On the other hand, in a stable environment, asexual reproduction would seem to be more advantageous, because it ensures perpetuation of successful combinations of alleles. Furthermore, asexual reproduction is less expensive; its energy costs to the organism are lower than those of sexual reproduction, for reasons that will be discussed in Chapter 46.</justification>

    <text>Why is equilibrium a dynamic balance instead of a static balance?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Recall that most chemical reactions are reversible and proceed to a point at which the forward and backward reactions occur at the same rate. The reaction is then said to be at chemical equilibrium, and there is no further net change in the relative concentration of products and reactants.</justification>

        <sentences>14, 15</sentences>
      </answer>
      <answer>
        <justification>The two opposite-headed arrows indicate that the reaction is reversible. One of the factors affecting the rate of a reaction is the concentration of reactants. The greater the concentration of reactant molecules, the more frequently they collide with one another and have an opportunity to react and form products. The same holds true for products. As products accumulate, collisions resulting in the reverse reaction become more frequent. Eventually, the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate, and the relative concentrations of products and reactants stop changing. The point at which the reactions offset one another exactly is called chemical equilibrium. This is a dynamic equilibrium; reactions are still going on, but with no net effect on the concentrations of reactants and products. Equilibrium does not mean that the reactants and products are equal in concentration, but only that their concentrations have stabilized at a particular ratio.</justification>

    <text>Why is chromatin important in meiosis?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Together, the entire complex of DNA and proteins that is the building material of chromosomes is referred to as chromatin. As you will soon see, the chromatin of a chromosome varies in its degree of condensation during the process of cell division. Every eukaryotic species has a characteristic number of chromosomes in each cell nucleus. For example, the nuclei of human somatic cells (all body cells except the reproductive cells) each contain 46 chromosomes, made up of two sets of 23, one set inherited from each parent. Reproductive cells, or gametes: sperm and eggs: have half as many chromosomes as somatic cells, or one set of 23 chromosomes in humans. The number of chromosomes in somatic cells varies widely among species: 18 in cabbage plants, 48 in chimpanzees, 56 in elephants, 90 in hedgehogs, and 148 in one species of alga. We'll now consider how these chromosomes behave during cell division.</justification>

        <justification>Together, this complex of DNA and protein, called chromatin, fits into the nucleus through an elaborate, multilevel system of packing. Our current view of the successive levels of DNA packing in a chromosome is outlined in Figure 16.22. Study this figure carefully before reading further. Chromatin undergoes striking changes in its degree of packing during the course of the cell cycle (see Figure 12.7). In interphase cells stained for light microscopy, the chromatin usually appears as a diffuse mass within the nucleus, suggesting that the chromatin is highly extended. As a cell prepares for mitosis, its chromatin coils and folds up (condenses), eventually forming a characteristic number of short, thick metaphase chromosomes that are distinguishable from each other with the light microscope. Though interphase chromatin is generally much less condensed than the chromatin of mitotic chromosomes, it shows several of the same levels of higher-order packing. Some of the chromatin comprising a 
chromosome seems to be present as a 10-nm fiber, but much is compacted into a 30-nm fiber, which in some regions is further folded into looped domains. Early on, biologists assumed that interphase chromatin was a tangled mass in the nucleus, like a bowl of spaghetti, but this is far from the case. Although an interphase chromosome lacks an obvious scaffold, its looped domains appear to be attached to the nuclear lamina, on the inside of the nuclear envelope, and perhaps also to fibers of the nuclear matrix. These attachments may help organize regions of chromatin where genes are active. The chromatin of each chromosome occupies a specific restricted area within the interphase nucleus, and the chromatin fibers of different chromosomes do not become entangled (Figure 16.23).</justification>

        <justification>At metaphase I of meiosis, chromosomes are positioned at the metaphase plate as pairs of homologs, rather than individual chromosomes, as in metaphase of mitosis. Separation of homologs. At anaphase I of meiosis, the duplicated chromosomes of each homologous pair move toward opposite poles, but the sister chromatids of each duplicated chromosome remain attached. In anaphase of mitosis, by contrast, sister chromatids separate. How do sister chromatids stay together through meiosis I but separate from each other in meiosis II and mitosis? Sister chromatids are attached along their lengths by protein complexes called cohesins. In mitosis, this attachment lasts until the end of metaphase, when enzymes cleave the cohesins, freeing the sister chromatids to move to opposite poles of the cell. In meiosis, sister chromatid cohesion is released in two steps, one at the start of anaphase I and one at anaphase II. In metaphase I, homologs are held together by cohesion between sister chromatid arms 
in regions beyond points of crossing over, where stretches of sister chromatids now belong to different chromosomes.</justification>

        <justification>Elaborate enzyme cascades amplify the cell's response to a signal. At each catalytic step in the cascade, the number of activated products is much greater than in the preceding step. For example, in the epinephrine-triggered pathway in Figure 11.16, each adenylyl cyclase molecule catalyzes the formation of many cAMP molecules, each molecule of protein kinase A phosphorylates many molecules of the next kinase in the pathway, and so on. The amplification effect stems from the fact that these proteins persist in the active form long enough to process numerous molecules of substrate before they become inactive again. As a result of the signal's amplification, a small number of epinephrine molecules binding to receptors on the surface of a liver cell or muscle cell can lead to the release of hundreds of millions of glucose molecules from glycogen.</justification>

The final protein activated is the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which uses inorganic phosphate to release glucose monomers from glycogen in the form of glucose 1-phosphate molecules.

      <answer>
        <justification>Many types of cells produce and secrete local regulators, molecules that act over short distances and reach their target cells solely by diffusion. Cytokines, for example, are local regulators that enable communication between immune cells (see Figures 43.16 and 43.19). Depending on the target cell, signaling by local regulators can be either paracrine or autocrine. In paracrine signaling (from the Greek para, to one side of), target cells lie near the secreting cell (Figure 45.2b). In autocrine signaling (from the Greek auto, self), the target cell is the secreting cell itself (Figure 45.2c). As we will discuss later in this chapter, paracrine and autocrine signaling play roles in many physiological processes, including blood pressure regulation, nervous system function, and reproduction.</justification>

Large-scale adaptive radiations occurred after each of the big five mass extinctions, when survivors became adapted to the many vacant ecological niches.

        <justification>The number of chromosomes in a single set is represented by n. Any cell with two chromosome sets is called a diploid cell and has a diploid number of chromosomes, abbreviated 2n. For humans, the diploid number is 46 (2n = 46), the number of chromosomes in our somatic cells. In a cell in which DNA synthesis has occurred, all the chromosomes are duplicated, and therefore each consists of two identical sister chromatids, associated closely at the centromere and along the arms. Figure 13.4 helps clarify the various terms that we use to describe duplicated chromosomes in a diploid cell. Study this figure so that you understand the differences between homologous chromosomes, sister chromatids, nonsister chromatids, and chromosome sets. Unlike somatic cells, gametes contain a single set of chromosomes. Such cells are called haploid cells, and each has a haploid number of chromosomes (n). For humans, the haploid number is 23 (n = 23). The set of 23 consists of the 22 autosomes plus a single 
sex chromosome. An unfertilized egg contains an X chromosome, but a sperm may contain an X or a Y chromosome. Note that each sexually reproducing species has a characteristic diploid number and haploid number.</justification>

        <justification>The human life cycle begins when a haploid sperm from the father fuses with a haploid egg from the mother. This union of gametes, culminating in fusion of their nuclei, is called fertilization. The resulting fertilized egg, or zygote, is diploid because it contains two haploid sets of chromosomes bearing genes representing the maternal and paternal family lines. As a human develops into a sexually mature adult, mitosis of the zygote and its descendant cells generates all the somatic cells of the body. Both chromosome sets in the zygote and all the genes they carry are passed with precision to the somatic cells. Figure 13.5 The human life cycle. In each generation, the number of chromosome sets doubles at fertilization but is halved during meiosis. For humans, the number of chromosomes in a haploid cell is 23, consisting of one set (n = 23); the number of chromosomes in the diploid zygote and all somatic cells arising from it is 46, consisting of two sets (2n = 46).</justification>

        <justification>Imagine what would happen if human gametes were made by mitosis: They would be diploid like the somatic cells. At the next round of fertilization, when two gametes fused, the normal chromosome number of 46 would double to 92, and each subsequent generation would double the number of chromosomes yet again. This does not happen, however, because in sexually reproducing organisms, gamete formation involves a type of cell division called meiosis. This type of cell division reduces the number of sets of chromosomes from two to one in the gametes, counterbalancing the doubling that occurs at fertilization. In animals, meiosis occurs only in germ cells, which are in the ovaries or testes. As a result of meiosis, each human sperm and egg is haploid (n = 23). Fertilization restores the diploid condition by combining two haploid sets of chromosomes, and the human life cycle is repeated, generation after generation (see Figure 13.5).</justification>

        <justification>The common feature of all three cycles is the alternation of meiosis and fertilization, key events that contribute to genetic variation among offspring. The cycles differ in the timing of these two key events. Although the alternation of meiosis and fertilization is common to all organisms that reproduce sexually, the timing of these two events in the life cycle varies, depending on the species. These variations can be grouped into three main types of life cycles. In the type that occurs in humans and most other animals, gametes are the only haploid cells. Meiosis occurs in germ cells during the production of gametes, which undergo no further cell division prior to fertilization. After fertilization, the diploid zygote divides by mitosis, producing a multicellular organism that is diploid (Figure 13.6a).</justification>

        <justification>13.2 Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles (pp. 250-253) As seen in a karyotype, normal human somatic cells are diploid. They have 46 chromosomes made up of two sets of 23: one set from each parent. In human diploid cells, there are 22 homologous pairs of autosomes, each with a maternal and a paternal homolog. The 23rd pair, the sex chromosomes, determines whether the person is female (XX) or male (XY). At sexual maturity in the human life cycle, ovaries and testes (the gonads) produce haploid gametes by meiosis, each gamete containing a single set of 23 chromosomes (n = 23). During fertilization, an egg and sperm unite, forming a diploid (2n = 46) single-celled zygote, which develops into a multicellular organism by mitosis. Sexual life cycles differ in the timing of meiosis relative to fertilization and in the point(s) of the cycle at which a multicellular organism is produced by mitosis.</justification>

Eukaryotic chromatin making up a chromosome is composed of DNA, histones, and other proteins. The histones bind to each other and to the DNA to form nucleosomes, the most basic units of DNA packing. Histone tails extend outward from each bead-like nucleosome core. Additional coiling and folding leads ultimately to the highly condensed chromatin of the metaphase chromosome. In interphase cells, most chromatin is less compacted (euchromatin), but some remains highly condensed (heterochromatin).

The location of a gene's promoter relative to nucleosomes and to the sites where the DNA attaches to the chromosome scaffold or nuclear lamina can affect whether the gene is transcribed. In addition, genes within heterochromatin, which is highly condensed, are usually not expressed.

        <justification>When ACTH reaches the adrenal cortex via the bloodstream, it stimulates the endocrine cells to synthesize and secrete a family of steroids called corticosteroids (Figure 45.21b). The two main types of corticosteroids in humans are glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. As reflected in their name, glucocorticoids have a primary effect on glucose metabolism. Augmenting the fuel-mobilizing effects of glucagon from the pancreas, glucocorticoids promote glucose synthesis from noncarbohydrate sources, such as proteins, making more glucose available as fuel. Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol (see Figure 45.5), act on skeletal muscle, causing the breakdown of muscle proteins. The resulting amino acids are transported to the liver and kidneys, where they are converted to glucose and released into the blood. The synthesis of glucose from muscle proteins provides circulating fuel when the body requires more glucose than the liver can mobilize from its glycogen stores. When glucocorticoids are 
introduced into the body at levels above those normally present, they suppress certain components of the body's immune system. Because of this anti-inflammatory effect, glucocorticoids are sometimes used to treat inflammatory diseases such as arthritis.</justification>

        <justification>A second photosynthetic adaptation to arid conditions has evolved in many succulent (water-storing) plants, numerous cacti, pineapples, and representatives of several other plant families. These plants open their stomata during the night and close them during the day, just the reverse of how other plants behave. Closing stomata during the day helps desert plants conserve water, but it also prevents CO2 from entering the leaves. During the night, when their stomata are open, these plants take up CO2 and incorporate it into a variety of organic acids. This mode of carbon fixation is called crassulacean acid metabolism, or CAM, after the plant family Crassulaceae, the succulents in which the process was first discovered. The mesophyll cells of CAM plants store the organic acids they make during the night in their vacuoles until morning, when the stomata close. During the day, when the light reactions can supply ATP and NADPH for the Calvin cycle, CO2 is released from the organic acids 
made the night before to become incorporated into sugar in the chloroplasts.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>The cycle begins by incorporating CO2 from the air into organic molecules already present in the chloroplast. This initial incorporation of carbon into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation. The Calvin cycle then reduces the fixed carbon to carbohydrate by the addition of electrons. The reducing power is provided by NADPH, which acquired its cargo of electrons in the light reactions. To convert CO2 to carbohydrate, the Calvin cycle also requires chemical energy in the form of ATP, which is also generated by the light reactions. Thus, it is the Calvin cycle that makes sugar, but it can do so only with the help of the NADPH and ATP produced by the light reactions. The metabolic steps of the Calvin cycle are sometimes referred to as the dark reactions, or light-independent reactions, because none of the steps requires light directly. Nevertheless, the Calvin cycle in most plants occurs during daylight, for only then can the light reactions provide the NADPH and ATP that the Calvin 
cycle requires. In essence, the chloroplast uses light energy to make sugar by coordinating the two stages of photosynthesis.</justification>

    <text>Why does inherited purely self-sacrificing behavior for the good of the species not occur in nature?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>How can such behaviors arise through natural selection? To answer this question, let's look more closely at some examples of unselfish behavior and then consider how such behaviors might arise. In discussing selflessness, we will use the term altruism to describe a behavior that reduces an animal's individual fitness but increases the fitness of other individuals in the population. Consider the Belding's ground squirrel, which lives in some mountainous regions of the western United States and is vulnerable to predators such as coyotes and hawks. A squirrel that sees a predator approach often gives a high-pitched alarm call that alerts unaware individuals to retreat to their burrows. Note that for the squirrel that warns others, the conspicuous alarm behavior increases the risk of being killed because it brings attention to the caller's location. Another example of altruistic behavior occurs in honeybee societies, in which the workers are sterile. The workers themselves never reproduce, 
but they labor on behalf of a single fertile queen. Furthermore, the workers sting intruders, a behavior that helps defend the hive but results in the death of those workers. Figure 51.27 Naked mole rats, a species of colonial mammal that exhibits altruistic behavior. Pictured here is a queen nursing offspring while surrounded by other members of the colony. Altruism is also observed in naked mole rats (Heterocephalus glaber), highly social rodents that live in underground chambers and tunnels in southern and northeastern Africa. The naked mole rat, which is almost hairless and nearly blind, lives in colonies of 75 to 250 or more individuals (Figure 51.27). Each colony has only one reproducing female, the queen, who mates with one to three males, called kings. The rest of the colony consists of nonreproductive females and males who forage for underground roots and tubers and care for the queen, the kings, and new offspring. The nonreproductive individuals may sacrifice their own lives in trying to protect 
the queen or kings from snakes or other predators that invade the colony.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>How can a Belding's ground squirrel, a worker honeybee, or a naked mole rat enhance its fitness by aiding members of the population that may be its closest competitors? How can altruistic behavior be maintained by evolution if it does not enhance the survival and reproductive success of the self-sacrificing individuals? The selection for altruistic behavior is most readily apparent in the case of parents sacrificing for their offspring. When parents sacrifice their own well-being to produce and aid offspring, this actually increases the fitness of the parents because it maximizes their genetic representation in the population. However, individuals sometimes help others who are not their offspring. Biologist William Hamilton proposed that an animal could increase its genetic representation in the next generation by "altruistically" helping close relatives other than its own offspring. Like parents and offspring, full siblings have half their genes in common. Therefore, selection might 
also favor helping siblings or helping one's parents produce more siblings. This idea led to Hamilton's idea of inclusive fitness, the total effect an individual has on proliferating its genes by producing its own offspring and by providing aid that enables other close relatives, who share many of those genes, to produce offspring.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>According to Hamilton, the three key variables in an act of altruism are the benefit to the recipient, the cost to the altruist, and the coefficient of relatedness. The benefit, B, is the average number of extra offspring that the beneficiary of an altruistic act produces. The cost, C, is how many fewer offspring the altruist produces. The coefficient of relatedness, r, equals the fraction of genes that, on average, are shared. Natural selection favors altruism when the benefit to the recipient multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness exceeds the cost to the altruist: in other words, when rB ' C. This statement is called Hamilton's rule.</justification>

    <text>Why are two traits that are more than 50cM away from each other inherited randomly relative to each other?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Some genes on a chromosome are so far from each other that a crossover between them is virtually certain. The observed frequency of recombination in crosses involving two such genes can have a maximum value of 50%, a result indistinguishable from that for genes on different chromosomes. In this case, the physical connection between genes on the same chromosome is not reflected in the results of genetic crosses. Despite being on the same chromosome and thus being physically connected, the genes are genetically unlinked; alleles of such genes assort independently, as if they were on different chromosomes. In fact, at least two of the genes for pea characters that Mendel studied are now known to be on the same chromosome, but the distance between them is so great that linkage is not observed in genetic crosses. Consequently, the two genes behaved as if they were on different chromosomes in Mendel's experiments.</justification>

    <text>Why is increased nitrate in water and the resulting increased bacterial growth bad for the environment?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Experimental deforestation of a watershed dramatically increased the flow of water and minerals leaving the watershed (Figure 55.16b and c). Over three years, water runoff from the newly deforested watershed was 30-40% greater than in a control watershed, apparently because there were no plants to absorb and transpire water from the soil. The concentration of Ca2+ in the creek increased 4-fold, and the concentration of K+ increased by a factor of 15. Most remarkable was the loss of nitrate, whose concentration in the creek increased 60-fold, reaching levels considered unsafe for drinking water (Figure 55.16c). The Hubbard Brook deforestation study showed that the amount of nutrients leaving an intact forest ecosystem is controlled mainly by the plants. Retaining nutrients in ecosystems helps to maintain the productivity of the systems and, in some cases, to avoid problems cause by excess nutrient runoff (see Figure 55.8).</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>In addition, as we saw in the case of Hubbard Brook (see Figure 55.16), without plants to take up nitrates from the soil, the nitrates are likely to be leached from the ecosystem. Recent studies indicate that human activities have more than doubled Earth's supply of fixed nitrogen available to primary producers. Industrial fertilizers provide the largest additional nitrogen source. Fossil fuel combustion also releases nitrogen oxides, which enter the atmosphere and dissolve in rainwater; the nitrogen ultimately enters ecosystems as nitrate. Increased cultivation of legumes, with their nitrogen-fixing symbionts, is a third way in which humans increase the amount of fixed nitrogen in the soil. A problem arises when the nutrient level in an ecosystem exceeds the critical load, the amount of added nutrient, usually nitrogen or phosphorus, that can be absorbed by plants without damaging ecosystem integrity. For example, nitrogenous minerals in the soil that exceed the critical load 
eventually leach into groundwater or run off into freshwater and marine ecosystems, contaminating water supplies and killing fish. Nitrate concentrations in groundwater are increasing in most agricultural regions, sometimes reaching levels that are unsafe for drinking.</justification>

    <text>Why do acquired characteristics complicate the idea that parents can pass on their traits to their offspring?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>The second principle, inheritance of acquired characteristics, stated that an organism could pass these modifications to its offspring. Lamarck reasoned that the long, muscular neck of the living giraffe had evolved over many generations as giraffes stretched their necks ever higher. Figure 22.4 Acquired traits cannot be inherited. This bonsai tree was "trained" to grow as a dwarf by pruning and shaping. However, seeds from this tree would produce offspring of normal size. Lamarck also thought that evolution happens because organisms have an innate drive to become more complex. Darwin rejected this idea, but he, too, thought that variation was introduced into the evolutionary process in part through inheritance of acquired characteristics. Today, however, our understanding of genetics refutes this mechanism: Experiments show that traits acquired by use during an individual's life are not inherited in the way proposed by Lamarck (Figure 22.4).</justification>

    <text>Why would a cell want to express lacI constitutively?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Lactose metabolism begins with hydrolysis of the disaccharide into its component monosaccharides, glucose and galactose, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme beta-galactosidase. Only a few molecules of this enzyme are present in an E. coli cell growing in the absence of lactose. If lactose is added to the bacterium's environment, however, the number of beta-galactosidase molecules in the cell increases a thousandfold within about 15 minutes. The gene for beta-galactosidase is part of the lac operon, which includes two other genes coding for enzymes that function in lactose utilization. The entire transcription unit is under the command of one main operator and promoter. The regulatory gene, lacI, located outside the operon, codes for an allosteric repressor protein that can switch off the lac operon by binding to the operator. So far, this sounds just like regulation of the trp operon, but there is one important difference. Recall that the trp repressor is inactive by itself and requires 
tryptophan as a corepressor in order to bind to the operator. The lac repressor, in contrast, is active by itself, binding to the operator and switching the lac operon off. In this case, a specific small molecule, called an inducer, inactivates the repressor.</justification>

        <justification>Bacterial cells that can conserve resources and energy have a selective advantage over cells that are unable to do so. Thus, natural selection has favored bacteria that express only the genes whose products are needed by the cell. Consider, for instance, an individual E. coli cell living in the erratic environment of a human colon, dependent for its nutrients on the whimsical eating habits of its host. If the environment is lacking in the amino acid tryptophan, which the bacterium needs to survive, the cell responds by activating a metabolic pathway that makes tryptophan from another compound. Later, if the human host eats a tryptophan-rich meal, the bacterial cell stops producing tryptophan, thus saving itself from squandering its resources to produce a substance that is available from the surrounding solution in prefabricated form.

    <text>Why doesn't ADP hydrolysis occur as much as ATP hydrolysis?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Because their hydrolysis releases energy, the phosphate bonds of ATP are sometimes referred to as high-energy phosphate bonds, but the term is misleading. The phosphate bonds of ATP are not unusually strong bonds, as "high-energy" may imply; rather, the reactants (ATP and water) themselves have high energy relative to the energy of the products (ADP and &amp;#9413;i). The release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change to a state of lower free energy, not from the phosphate bonds themselves. ATP is useful to the cell because the energy it releases on losing a phosphate group is somewhat greater than the energy most other molecules could deliver. But why does this hydrolysis release so much energy? If we reexamine the ATP molecule in Figure 8.8a, we can see that all three phosphate groups are negatively charged. These like charges are crowded together, and their mutual repulsion contributes to the instability of this region of the ATP molecule. The 
triphosphate tail of ATP is the chemical equivalent of a compressed spring.</justification>

        <justification>Crossing over begins very early in prophase I as homologous chromosomes pair loosely along their lengths. Each gene on one homolog is aligned precisely with the corresponding gene on the other homolog. In a single crossover event, the DNA of two nonsister chromatids: one maternal and one paternal chromatid of a homologous pair: is broken by specific proteins at precisely corresponding points, and the two segments beyond the crossover point are each joined to the other chromatid. Thus, a paternal chromatid is joined to a piece of maternal chromatid beyond the crossover point, and vice versa.

Epinephrine and thyroxine are amine hormones, each synthesized from a single amino acid, either tyrosine or tryptophan. As Figure 45.5 indicates, hormones vary in their solubility in aqueous and lipid-rich environments. Polypeptides and most amine hormones are water-soluble. Being insoluble in lipids, these hormones cannot pass through the plasma membranes of cells. Instead, they bind to cell-surface receptors that relay information to the nucleus through intracellular pathways. In contrast, steroid hormones, as well as other largely nonpolar (hydrophobic) hormones, such as thyroxine, are lipid-soluble and can pass through cell membranes readily.

        <justification>The reaction catalyzed by each enzyme is very specific; an enzyme can recognize its specific substrate even among closely related compounds. For instance, sucrase will act only on sucrose and will not bind to other disaccharides, such as maltose. What accounts for this molecular recognition? Recall that most enzymes are proteins, and proteins are macromolecules with unique three-dimensional configurations. The specificity of an enzyme results from its shape, which is a consequence of its amino acid sequence. Figure 8.14 Induced fit between an enzyme and its substrate. Only a restricted region of the enzyme molecule actually binds to the substrate. This region, called the active site, is typically a pocket or groove on the surface of the enzyme where catalysis occurs (Figure 8.14a). Usually, the active site is formed by only a few of the enzyme's amino acids, with the rest of the protein molecule providing a framework that determines the configuration of the active site. The specificity 
of an enzyme is attributed to a compatible fit between the shape of its active site and the shape of the substrate.</justification>

    <text>Why is a new flu vaccine required each year?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>One mechanism for escaping the body's defenses is for a pathogen to alter how it appears to the immune system. Immunological memory is a record of the foreign epitopes an animal has encountered. If the pathogen that expressed those epitopes no longer does so, it can reinfect or remain in a host without triggering the rapid and robust response that memory cells provide. Such changes in epitope expression, which are called antigenic variation, are regular events for some viruses and parasites. The parasite that causes sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) provides one example. By periodically switching at random among 1,000 different versions of the protein found over its entire surface, this pathogen can persist in the body without facing an effective adaptive immune response (Figure 43.24). Antigenic variation is the major reason the influenza, or "flu," virus remains a major public health problem. As it replicates in one human host after another, the human influenza virus mutates. 
Because any change that lessens recognition by the immune system provides a selective advantage, the virus steadily accumulates such alterations. These changes in the surface proteins of the influenza virus are the reason that a new flu vaccine must be manufactured and distributed each year.</justification>

    <text>Why aren't all hormones secreted from the same gland?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>45.3 The hypothalamus and pituitary are central to endocrine regulation (pp. 984-989) Some neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus produce hormones secreted by the posterior pituitary. Other hypothalamic cells produce hormones that are transported by portal vessels to the anterior pituitary, where they stimulate or inhibit the release of particular hormones. The two hormones released from the posterior pituitary act directly on nonendocrine tissues. Oxytocin induces uterine contractions and release of milk from mammary glands, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) enhances water reabsorption in the kidneys. Often, anterior pituitary hormones act in a cascade. In the case of thyrotropin, or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), TSH secretion is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TSH in turn induces the thyroid gland to secrete thyroid hormone, a combination of the iodine-containing hormones T3 and T4.</justification>

    <text>Why is it important for carbon dioxide to be highly concentrated in cells with rubisco?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>In addition, rubisco can bind O2 in place of CO2. As CO2 becomes scarce within the air spaces of the leaf, rubisco adds O2 to the Calvin cycle instead of CO2. The product splits, and a two-carbon compound leaves the chloroplast. Peroxisomes and mitochondria rearrange and split this compound, releasing CO2. The process is called photorespiration because it occurs in the light (photo) and consumes O2 while producing CO2 (respiration). However, unlike normal cellular respiration, photorespiration generates no ATP; in fact, photorespiration consumes ATP. And unlike photosynthesis, photorespiration produces no sugar. In fact, photorespiration decreases photosynthetic output by siphoning organic material from the Calvin cycle and releasing CO2 that would otherwise be fixed.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>The first prokaryotes assigned to domain Archaea live in environments so extreme that few other organisms can survive there. Such organisms are called extremophiles, meaning "lovers" of extreme conditions (from the Greek philos, lover), and include extreme halophiles and extreme thermophiles. Extreme halophiles (from the Greek halo, salt) live in highly saline environments, such as the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea (see Figure 27.1). Some species merely tolerate salinity, while others require an environment that is several times saltier than seawater (which has a salinity of 3.5%). For example, the proteins and cell wall of Halobacterium have unusual features that improve function in extremely salty environments but render these organisms incapable of survival if the salinity drops below 9%. Figure 27.16 Extreme thermophiles. Orange and yellow colonies of thermophilic prokaryotes grow in the hot water of a Nevada geyser. Extreme thermophiles (from the Greek thermos, hot) thrive in 
very hot environments (Figure 27.16). For example, archaea in the genus Sulfolobus live in sulfur-rich volcanic springs as hot as 90 degree C. At temperatures this high, the cells of most organisms die because, for example, their DNA does not remain in a double helix and many of their proteins denature. Sulfolobus and other extreme thermophiles avoid this fate because their DNA and proteins have adaptations that make them stable at high temperatures. One extreme thermophile that lives near deep-sea hot springs called hydrothermal vents is informally known as "strain 121," since it can reproduce even at 121 degree C. Another extreme thermophile, Pyrococcus furiosus, is used in biotechnology as a source of DNA polymerase for the PCR technique (see Chapter 20). Other archaea live in more moderate environments. Consider the methanogens, archaea that release methane as a by-product of their unique ways of obtaining energy. Many methanogens use CO2 to oxidize H2, a process that produces both energy and methane 
waste. Among the strictest of anaerobes, methanogens are poisoned by O2. Although some methanogens live in extreme environments, such as under kilometers of ice in Greenland, others live in swamps and marshes where other microorganisms have consumed all the O2. The "marsh gas" found in such environments is the methane released by these archaea. Other species of methanogens inhabit the anaerobic environment within the guts of cattle, termites, and other herbivores, playing an essential role in the nutrition of these animals. Methanogens also have an important application as decomposers in sewage treatment facilities. Many extreme halophiles and all known methanogens are archaea in the clade Euryarchaeota (from the Greek eurys, broad, a reference to the habitat range of these prokaryotes). The euryarchaeotes also include some extreme thermophiles, though most thermophilic species belong to a second clade, Crenarchaeota (cren means "spring," such as a hydrothermal spring). Recently, genetic prospecting has 
revealed many species of euryarchaeotes and crenarchaeotes that are not extremophiles. These archaea exist in habitats ranging from farm soils to lake sediments to the surface waters of the open ocean. New findings continue to update the picture of archaeal phylogeny. In 1996, researchers sampling a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park discovered archaea that do not appear to belong to either Euryarchaeota or Crenarchaeota. They placed these archaea in a new clade, Korarchaeota (from the Greek koron, young man). In 2002, researchers exploring hydrothermal vents off the coast of Iceland discovered archaeal cells only 0.4 microm in diameter attached to a much larger crenarchaeote. The genome of the smaller archaean is one of the smallest known of any organism, containing only 500,000 base pairs. Genetic analysis indicates that this prokaryote belongs to a fourth archaeal clade, Nanoarchaeota (from the Greek nanos, dwarf). Within a year after this clade was named, three other DNA sequences from nanoarchaeote 
species were isolated: one from Yellowstone's hot springs, one from hot springs in Siberia, and one from a hydrothermal vent in the Pacific. As prospecting continues, it seems likely that the tree in Figure 27.15 will undergo further changes.</justification>

    <text>Why do some lymphocytes remain even after an antigen has been eliminated?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>To begin with, an antigen is presented to a steady stream of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes (see Figure 43.7) until a match is made. A successful match then triggers changes in cell number and activity for the lymphocyte to which an antigen has bound. The binding of an antigen receptor to an epitope initiates events that activate the lymphocyte. Once activated, a B cell or T cell undergoes multiple cell divisions. For each activated cell, the result of this proliferation is a clone, a population of cells that are identical to the original cell. Some cells from this clone become effector cells, short-lived cells that take effect immediately against the antigen and any pathogens producing that antigen. The effector forms of B cells are plasma cells, which secrete antibodies. The effector forms of T cells are helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, whose roles we'll explore in Concept 43.3. The remaining cells in the clone become memory cells, long-lived cells that can give rise to effector 
cells if the same antigen is encountered later in the animal's life.</justification>

        <justification>Immunological memory is responsible for the long-term protection that a prior infection or vaccination provides against many diseases, such as chickenpox. This type of protection was noted almost 2,400 years ago by the Greek historian Thucydides. He observed that individuals who had recovered from the plague could safely care for those who were sick or dying, "for the same man was never attacked twice: never at least fatally. " Figure 43.15 The specificity of immunological memory. Long-lived memory cells generated in the primary response to antigen A give rise to a heightened secondary response to the same antigen, but do not affect the primary response to a different antigen (B). Prior exposure to an antigen alters the speed, strength, and duration of the immune response. The production of effector cells from a clone of lymphocytes during the first exposure to an antigen is the basis for the primary immune response. The primary response peaks about 10-17 days after the initial 
exposure. During this time, selected B cells and T cells give rise to their effector forms. If an individual is exposed again to the same antigen, the response is faster (typically peaking only 2-7 days after exposure), of greater magnitude, and more prolonged.

Upon infection, B and T cells specific for the pathogen are activated. Some T cells help other lymphocytes; others kill infected host cells.

The number and variety of pigment molecules enable a photosystem to harvest light over a larger surface area and a larger portion of the spectrum than could any single pigment molecule alone. Together, these light-harvesting complexes act as an antenna for the reaction-center complex.

      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 8.16 Environmental factors affecting enzyme activity. Each enzyme has an optimal (a) temperature and (b) pH that favor the most active shape of the protein molecule. Temperature and pH are environmental factors important in the activity of an enzyme. Up to a point, the rate of an enzymatic reaction increases with increasing temperature, partly because substrates collide with active sites more frequently when the molecules move rapidly. Above that temperature, however, the speed of the enzymatic reaction drops sharply. The thermal agitation of the enzyme molecule disrupts the hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and other weak interactions that stabilize the active shape of the enzyme, and the protein molecule eventually denatures. Each enzyme has an optimal temperature at which its reaction rate is greatest. Without denaturing the enzyme, this temperature allows the greatest number of molecular collisions and the fastest conversion of the reactants to product molecules. Most human 
enzymes have optimal temperatures of about 35-40 degree C (close to human body temperature). The thermophilic bacteria that live in hot springs contain enzymes with optimal temperatures of 70 degree C or higher (Figure 8.16a on the next page). Just as each enzyme has an optimal temperature, it also has a pH at which it is most active. The optimal pH values for most enzymes fall in the range of pH 6-8, but there are exceptions. For example, pepsin, a digestive enzyme in the human stomach, works best at pH 2. Such an acidic environment denatures most enzymes, but pepsin is adapted to maintain its functional three-dimensional structure in the acidic environment of the stomach. In contrast, trypsin, a digestive enzyme residing in the alkaline environment of the human intestine, has an optimal pH of 8 and would be denatured in the stomach (Figure 8.16b).</justification>

However, the hydrophobic interior of the membrane impedes the direct passage of ions and polar molecules, which are hydrophilic, through the membrane. Polar molecules such as glucose and other sugars pass only slowly through a lipid bilayer, and even water, an extremely small polar molecule, does not cross very rapidly. A charged atom or molecule and its surrounding shell of water (see Figure 3.7) find the hydrophobic interior of the membrane even more difficult to penetrate. Furthermore, the lipid bilayer is only one aspect of the gatekeeper system responsible for the selective permeability of a cell.

      <answer>
        <justification>Cell membranes are permeable to specific ions and a variety of polar molecules. These hydrophilic substances can avoid contact with the lipid bilayer by passing through transport proteins that span the membrane. Some transport proteins, called channel proteins, function by having a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or atomic ions use as a tunnel through the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, left). For example, the passage of water molecules through the membrane in certain cells is greatly facilitated by channel proteins known as aquaporins. Each aquaporin allows entry of up to 3 billion (3 * 109) water molecules per second, passing single file through its central channel, which fits ten at a time. Without aquaporins, only a tiny fraction of these water molecules would pass through the same area of the cell membrane in a second, so the channel protein brings about a tremendous increase in rate. Other transport proteins, called carrier proteins, hold onto their passengers and change 
shape in a way that shuttles them across the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, right). A transport protein is specific for the substance it translocates (moves), allowing only a certain substance (or a small group of related substances) to cross the membrane.</justification>

        <justification>EVOLUTION Ever since plants first moved onto land about 475 million years ago, they have been adapting to the problems of terrestrial life, particularly the problem of dehydration. In Chapters 29 and 36, we will consider anatomical adaptations that help plants conserve water, while in this chapter we are concerned with metabolic adaptations. The solutions often involve trade-offs. An important example is the compromise between photosynthesis and the prevention of excessive water loss from the plant. The CO2 required for photosynthesis enters a leaf via stomata, the pores on the leaf surface (see Figure 10.4). However, stomata are also the main avenues of transpiration, the evaporative loss of water from leaves. On a hot, dry day, most plants close their stomata, a response that conserves water. This response also reduces photosynthetic yield by limiting access to CO2. With stomata even partially closed, CO2 concentrations begin to decrease in the air spaces within the leaf, and the 
concentration of O2 released from the light reactions begins to increase.</justification>

        <justification>Transpirational Pull Stomata on a leaf's surface lead to a maze of internal air spaces that expose the mesophyll cells to the CO2 they need for photosynthesis. The air in these spaces is saturated with water vapor because it is in contact with the moist walls of the cells. On most days, the air outside the leaf is drier; that is, it has lower water potential than the air inside the leaf. Therefore, water vapor in the air spaces of a leaf diffuses down its water potential gradient and exits the leaf via the stomata. It is this loss of water vapor by diffusion and evaporation that we call transpiration.</justification>

        <justification>The role of negative pressure potential in transpiration is consistent with the water potential equation because negative pressure potential (tension) lowers water potential (see Figure 36.8). Because water moves from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water potential, the more negative pressure potential at the air-water interface causes water in xylem cells to be "pulled" into mesophyll cells, which lose water to the air spaces, the water diffusing out through stomata. In this way, the negative water potential of leaves provides the "pull" in transpirational pull. The transpirational pull on xylem sap is transmitted all the way from the leaves to the root tips and even into the soil solution (Figure 36.13).</justification>

    <text>Why are the reaction environments for chlorophyll a different between the two photosystems?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>The thylakoid membrane is populated by two types of photosystems that cooperate in the light reactions of photosynthesis. They are called photosystem II (PS II) and photosystem I (PS I). (They were named in order of their discovery, but photosystem II functions first in the light reactions. ) Each has a characteristic reaction-center complex: a particular kind of primary electron acceptor next to a special pair of chlorophyll a molecules associated with specific proteins. The reaction-center chlorophyll a of photosystem II is known as P680 because this pigment is best at absorbing light having a wavelength of 680 nm (in the red part of the spectrum). The chlorophyll a at the reaction-center complex of photosystem I is called P700 because it most effectively absorbs light of wavelength 700 nm (in the far-red part of the spectrum). These two pigments, P680 and P700, are nearly identical chlorophyll a molecules. However, their association with different proteins in the thylakoid membrane 
affects the electron distribution in the two pigments and accounts for the slight differences in their light-absorbing properties. Now let's see how the two photosystems work together in using light energy to generate ATP and NADPH, the two main products of the light reactions.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>The light reactions are the steps of photosynthesis that convert solar energy to chemical energy. Water is split, providing a source of electrons and protons (hydrogen ions, H+) and giving off O2 as a by-product. Light absorbed by chlorophyll drives a transfer of the electrons and hydrogen ions from water to an acceptor called NADP+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), where they are temporarily stored. The electron acceptor NADP+ is first cousin to NAD+, which functions as an electron carrier in cellular respiration; the two molecules differ only by the presence of an extra phosphate group in the NADP+ molecule. The light reactions use solar power to reduce NADP+ to NADPH by adding a pair of electrons along with an H+. The light reactions also generate ATP, using chemiosmosis to power the addition of a phosphate group to ADP, a process called photophosphorylation. Thus, light energy is initially converted to chemical energy in the form of two compounds: NADPH, a source of 
electrons as "reducing power" that can be passed along to an electron acceptor, reducing it, and ATP, the versatile energy currency of cells. Notice that the light reactions produce no sugar; that happens in the second stage of photosynthesis, the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle is named for Melvin Calvin, who, along with his colleagues, began to elucidate its steps in the late 1940s. The cycle begins by incorporating CO2 from the air into organic molecules already present in the chloroplast. This initial incorporation of carbon into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation. The Calvin cycle then reduces the fixed carbon to carbohydrate by the addition of electrons. The reducing power is provided by NADPH, which acquired its cargo of electrons in the light reactions. To convert CO2 to carbohydrate, the Calvin cycle also requires chemical energy in the form of ATP, which is also generated by the light reactions. Thus, it is the Calvin cycle that makes sugar, but it can do so only with the help of the 
NADPH and ATP produced by the light reactions. The metabolic steps of the Calvin cycle are sometimes referred to as the dark reactions, or light-independent reactions, because none of the steps requires light directly. Nevertheless, the Calvin cycle in most plants occurs during daylight, for only then can the light reactions provide the NADPH and ATP that the Calvin cycle requires. In essence, the chloroplast uses light energy to make sugar by coordinating the two stages of photosynthesis.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Which type of plant would stand to gain more from increasing CO2 levels? Recall that in C3 plants, the binding of O2 rather than CO2 by rubisco leads to photorespiration, lowering the efficiency of photosynthesis. C4 plants overcome this problem by concentrating CO2 in the bundle-sheath cells at the cost of ATP. Rising CO2 levels should benefit C3 plants by lowering the amount of photorespiration that occurs. At the same time, rising temperatures have the opposite effect, increasing photorespiration. (Other factors such as water availability may also come into play. ) In contrast, many C4 plants could be largely unaffected by increasing CO2 levels or temperature. In different regions, the particular combination of these two factors is likely to alter the balance of C3 and C4 plants in varying ways. The effects of such a widespread and variable change in community structure are unpredictable and thus a cause of legitimate concern.</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>In another kind of allosteric activation, a substrate molecule binding to one active site in a multisubunit enzyme triggers a shape change in all the subunits, thereby increasing catalytic activity at the other active sites (Figure 8.19b). Called cooperativity, this mechanism amplifies the response of enzymes to substrates: One substrate molecule primes an enzyme to act on additional substrate molecules more readily. Cooperativity is considered "allosteric" regulation because binding of the substrate to one active site affects catalysis in another active site. Although the vertebrate oxygen transport protein hemoglobin is not an enzyme, classic studies of cooperative binding in this protein have elucidated the principle of cooperativity. Hemoglobin is made up of four subunits, each of which has an oxygen-binding site (see Figure 5.20). The binding of an oxygen molecule to one binding site increases the affinity for oxygen of the remaining binding sites. Thus, where oxygen is at high 
levels, such as in the lungs or gills, hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases as more binding sites are filled. In oxygen-deprived tissues, however, the release of each oxygen molecule decreases the oxygen affinity of the other binding sites, resulting in the release of oxygen where it is most needed. Cooperativity works similarly in multisubunit enzymes that have been studied.</justification>

        <justification>As discussed in Chapter 40, when an animal takes in more energy-rich molecules than it needs for metabolism and activity, it stores the excess energy. In concluding our overview of nutrition, we'll examine some ways in which animals manage their energy allocation. In humans, the first sites used for energy storage are liver and muscle cells. In these cells, excess energy from the diet is stored in glycogen, a polymer made up of many glucose units (see Figure 5.6b). Once glycogen depots are full, any additional excess energy is usually stored in fat in adipose cells. When fewer calories are taken in than are expended: perhaps because of sustained heavy exercise or lack of food: the human body generally expends liver glycogen first and then draws on muscle glycogen and fat. Fats are especially rich in energy; oxidizing a gram of fat liberates about twice the energy liberated from a gram of carbohydrate or protein. For this reason, adipose tissue provides the most space-efficient way for 
the body to store large amounts of energy. Most healthy people have enough stored fat to sustain them through several weeks without food.</justification>

The pancreatic hormones insulin and glucagon maintain glucose homeostasis by tightly regulating the synthesis and breakdown of glycogen. Figure 41.20 Homeostatic regulation of cellular fuel. After a meal is digested, glucose and other monomers are absorbed into the blood from the digestive tract. The human body regulates the use and storage of glucose, a major cellular fuel. The liver is a key site for glucose homeostasis (Figure 41.20). When insulin levels rise after a carbohydrate-rich meal, glucose entering the liver in the hepatic portal vein is used to synthesize glycogen. Between meals, when blood in the hepatic portal vein has a much lower glucose concentration, glucagon stimulates the liver to break down 
glycogen, releasing glucose into the blood. Through the combined action of insulin and glucagon, blood exiting the liver has a glucose concentration of 70-110 mg per 100 mL at nearly all times.</justification>

To explore the role of signal transduction in hormone signaling, consider one response to short-term stress. When you find yourself in a stressful situation, perhaps running to catch a bus, your adrenal glands secrete epinephrine, a hormone also called adrenaline. When epinephrine reaches the liver, it binds to a G protein-coupled receptor in the plasma membrane of target cells, as discussed in Chapter 11 and reviewed in Figure 45.7. The binding of hormone to receptor triggers a cascade of events involving synthesis of cyclic AMP (cAMP) as a short-lived second messenger. Activation of protein kinase A by cAMP leads to activation of an enzyme required for glycogen breakdown and inactivation of an enzyme necessary for glycogen synthesis.

Consider the effects of epinephrine in mediating the body's response to short-term stress (Figure 45.9). Epinephrine simultaneously triggers glycogen breakdown in the liver, increased blood flow to major skeletal muscles, and decreased blood flow to the digestive tract. These varied effects enhance the rapid reactions of the body in emergencies. Tissues vary in their response to epinephrine because they vary in their receptors or in their signal transduction pathways.

        <justification>In humans, metabolic balance depends on a blood glucose concentration of 70-110 mg/100 mL. Because glucose is a major fuel for cellular respiration and a key source of carbon skeletons for biosynthesis, maintaining blood glucose concentrations near this normal range is critical. Figure 45.13 Maintenance of glucose homeostasis by insulin and glucagon. The antagonistic effects of insulin and glucagon help keep blood glucose levels in the normal range. Two antagonistic (opposing) hormones, insulin and glucagon, regulate the concentration of glucose in the blood (Figure 45.13). Each of these hormones operates in a simple endocrine pathway regulated by negative feedback. When blood glucose rises above the normal range, release of insulin triggers uptake of glucose from the blood into body cells, decreasing the blood glucose concentration. When blood glucose drops below the normal range, the release of glucagon promotes the release of glucose into the blood from energy stores, such as liver 
glycogen, increasing the blood glucose concentration. Because insulin and glucagon have opposing effects, the combined activity of these two hormones tightly controls the concentration of glucose in the blood.</justification>

        <justification>Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating nearly all body cells outside the brain to take up glucose from the blood. (Brain cells can take up glucose without insulin, so the brain almost always has access to circulating fuel. ) Insulin also decreases blood glucose by slowing glycogen breakdown in the liver and inhibiting the conversion of glycerol (from fats) and amino acids to glucose. Glucagon influences blood glucose levels mainly through its effects on target cells in the liver. The liver, skeletal muscles, and adipose tissues store large amounts of fuel. The liver and muscles store sugar as glycogen, whereas cells in adipose tissue convert sugars to fats. When the blood glucose level decreases to a level at or below the normal range (70-110 mg/100 mL), a primary effect of glucagon is to signal liver cells to increase glycogen hydrolysis, convert amino acids and glycerol to glucose, and release glucose into the bloodstream. The net result is a return of the blood glucose

As shown in Figure 5.12, a phospholipid is similar to a fat molecule but has only two fatty acids attached to glycerol rather than three. The third hydroxyl group of glycerol is joined to a phosphate group, which has a negative electrical charge in the cell. Additional small molecules, which are usually charged or polar, can be linked to the phosphate group to form a variety of phospholipids. Figure 5.13 Bilayer structure formed by self-assembly of phospholipids in an aqueous environment. The phospholipid bilayer shown here is the main fabric of biological membranes. Note that the hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids are in contact with water in this structure, whereas the hydrophobic tails are in contact with each other and remote from 
water. The two ends of phospholipids show different behavior toward water. The hydrocarbon tails are hydrophobic and are excluded from water. However, the phosphate group and its attachments form a hydrophilic head that has an affinity for water. When phospholipids are added to water, they self-assemble into double-layered structures called "bilayers," shielding their hydrophobic portions from water (Figure 5.13). At the surface of a cell, phospholipids are arranged in a similar bilayer. The hydrophilic heads of the molecules are on the outside of the bilayer, in contact with the aqueous solutions inside and outside of the cell. The hydrophobic tails point toward the interior of the bilayer, away from the water. The phospholipid bilayer forms a boundary between the cell and its external environment; in fact, cells could not exist without phospholipids.</justification>

        <justification>EVOLUTION Ever since plants first moved onto land about 475 million years ago, they have been adapting to the problems of terrestrial life, particularly the problem of dehydration. In Chapters 29 and 36, we will consider anatomical adaptations that help plants conserve water, while in this chapter we are concerned with metabolic adaptations. The solutions often involve trade-offs. An important example is the compromise between photosynthesis and the prevention of excessive water loss from the plant. The CO2 required for photosynthesis enters a leaf via stomata, the pores on the leaf surface (see Figure 10.4). However, stomata are also the main avenues of transpiration, the evaporative loss of water from leaves. On a hot, dry day, most plants close their stomata, a response that conserves water.</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 9.20 The control of cellular respiration. Allosteric enzymes at certain points in the respiratory pathway respond to inhibitors and activators that help set the pace of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes an early step in glycolysis (see Figure 9.9), is one such enzyme. It is stimulated by AMP (derived from ADP) but is inhibited by ATP and by citrate. This feedback regulation adjusts the rate of respiration as the cell's catabolic and anabolic demands change. The cell also controls its catabolism. If the cell is working hard and its ATP concentration begins to drop, respiration speeds up. When there is plenty of ATP to meet demand, respiration slows down, sparing valuable organic molecules for other functions. Again, control is based mainly on regulating the activity of enzymes at strategic points in the catabolic pathway. As shown in Figure 9.20, one important switch is phosphofructokinase, the enzyme that catalyzes step 3 of glycolysis (
see Figure 9.9). That is the first step that commits the substrate irreversibly to the glycolytic pathway. By controlling the rate of this step, the cell can speed up or slow down the entire catabolic process. Phosphofructokinase can thus be considered the pacemaker of respiration. Phosphofructokinase is an allosteric enzyme with receptor sites for specific inhibitors and activators. It is inhibited by ATP and stimulated by AMP (adenosine monophosphate), which the cell derives from ADP. As ATP accumulates, inhibition of the enzyme slows down glycolysis. The enzyme becomes active again as cellular work converts ATP to ADP (and AMP) faster than ATP is being regenerated. Phosphofructokinase is also sensitive to citrate, the first product of the citric acid cycle. If citrate accumulates in mitochondria, some of it passes into the cytosol and inhibits phosphofructokinase. This mechanism helps synchronize the rates of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. As citrate accumulates, glycolysis slows down, and the 
supply of acetyl groups to the citric acid cycle decreases. If citrate consumption increases, either because of a demand for more ATP or because anabolic pathways are draining off intermediates of the citric acid cycle, glycolysis accelerates and meets the demand. Metabolic balance is augmented by the control of enzymes that catalyze other key steps of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.</justification>

In aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is oxygen; in anaerobic respiration, the final acceptor is another molecule that is electronegative (although invariably less so than oxygen).

        <justification>How do electrons that are extracted from glucose and stored as potential energy in NADH finally reach oxygen? It will help to compare the redox chemistry of cellular respiration to a much simpler reaction: the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water (Figure 9.5a). Mix H2 and O2, provide a spark for activation energy, and the gases combine explosively. In fact, combustion of liquid H2 and O2 is harnessed to power the main engines of the space shuttle after it is launched, boosting it into orbit. The explosion represents a release of energy as the electrons of hydrogen "fall" closer to the electronegative oxygen atoms. Cellular respiration also brings hydrogen and oxygen together to form water, but there are two important differences. First, in cellular respiration, the hydrogen that reacts with oxygen is derived from organic molecules rather than H2. Second, instead of occurring in one explosive reaction, respiration uses an electron transport chain to break the fall of 
electrons to oxygen into several energy-releasing steps (Figure 9.5b). An electron transport chain consists of a number of molecules, mostly proteins, built into the inner membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and the plasma membrane of aerobically respiring prokaryotes. Electrons removed from glucose are shuttled by NADH to the "top," higher-energy end of the chain. At the "bottom," lower-energy end, O2 captures these electrons along with hydrogen nuclei (H+), forming water. Electron transfer from NADH to oxygen is an exergonic reaction with a free-energy change of -'53 kcal/mol (-'222 kJ/mol). Instead of this energy being released and wasted in a single explosive step, electrons cascade down the chain from one carrier molecule to the next in a series of redox reactions, losing a small amount of energy with each step until they finally reach oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor, which has a very great affinity for electrons. Each "downhill" carrier is more electronegative than, and thus capable 
of oxidizing, its "uphill" neighbor, with oxygen at the bottom of the chain. Therefore, the electrons removed from glucose by NAD+ fall down an energy gradient in the electron transport chain to a far more stable location in the electronegative oxygen atom. Put another way, oxygen pulls electrons down the chain in an energy-yielding tumble analogous to gravity pulling objects downhill. In summary, during cellular respiration, most electrons travel the following "downhill" route: glucose&amp;rarr; NADH&amp;rarr; electron transport chain&amp;rarr; oxygen.</justification>

        <justification>We have already mentioned anaerobic respiration, which takes place in certain prokaryotic organisms that live in environments without oxygen. These organisms have an electron transport chain but do not use oxygen as a final electron acceptor at the end of the chain. Oxygen performs this function very well because it is extremely electronegative, but other, less electronegative substances can also serve as final electron acceptors. Some "sulfate-reducing" marine bacteria, for instance, use the sulfate ion (SO42-') at the end of their respiratory chain. Operation of the chain builds up a proton-motive force used to produce ATP, but H2S (hydrogen sulfide) is produced as a by-product rather than water.

The most common mechanism for this control is feedback inhibition: The end product of the anabolic pathway inhibits the enzyme that catalyzes an early step of the pathway (see Figure 8.21). This prevents the needless diversion of key metabolic intermediates from uses that are more urgent. Figure 9.20 The control of cellular respiration.

A remarkable film only about 8 nm thick: it would take over 8,000 plasma membranes to equal the thickness of this page: the plasma membrane controls traffic into and out of the cell it surrounds. Like all biological membranes, the plasma membrane exhibits selective permeability; that is, it allows some substances to cross it more easily than others. One of the earliest episodes in the evolution of life may have been the formation of a membrane that enclosed a solution different from the surrounding solution while still permitting the uptake of nutrients and elimination of waste products. The ability of the cell to discriminate in its chemical exchanges with its environment is fundamental to life, and it is the plasma membrane and its component molecules that make this selectivity possible. Figure 7.1 How do cell membrane proteins help regulate chemical traffic? In this chapter, 
you will learn how cellular membranes control the passage of substances. The image in Figure 7.1 shows the elegant structure of a eukaryotic plasma membrane protein that plays a crucial role in nerve cell signaling. This protein provides a channel for a stream of potassium ions (K+) to exit a nerve cell at a precise moment after nerve stimulation, restoring the cell's ability to fire again. (The orange ball in the center represents one potassium ion moving through the channel. ) In this way, the plasma membrane and its proteins not only act as an outer boundary but also enable the cell to carry out its functions.

When ATP allosterically inhibits an enzyme in an ATP-generating pathway, as we discussed earlier, the result is feedback inhibition, a common mode of metabolic control. In feedback inhibition, a metabolic pathway is switched off by the inhibitory binding of its end product to an enzyme that acts early in the pathway. Figure 8.21 shows an example of this control mechanism operating on an anabolic pathway. Certain cells use this five-step pathway to synthesize the amino acid isoleucine from threonine, another amino acid. As isoleucine accumulates, it slows down its own synthesis by allosterically inhibiting the enzyme for the first step of the pathway.

The activity of the first enzyme in the tryptophan synthesis pathway is inhibited by the pathway's end product (Figure 18.2a).

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>EVOLUTION The role of glycolysis in both fermentation and respiration has an evolutionary basis. Ancient prokaryotes are thought to have used glycolysis to make ATP long before oxygen was present in Earth's atmosphere. The oldest known fossils of bacteria date back 3.5 billion years, but appreciable quantities of oxygen probably did not begin to accumulate in the atmosphere until about 2.7 billion years ago. Cyanobacteria produced this O2 as a by-product of photosynthesis. Therefore, early prokaryotes may have generated ATP exclusively from glycolysis. The fact that glycolysis is today the most widespread metabolic pathway among Earth's organisms suggests that it evolved very early in the history of life. The cytosolic location of glycolysis also implies great antiquity; the pathway does not require any of the membrane-bounded organelles of the eukaryotic cell, which evolved approximately 1 billion years after the prokaryotic cell. Glycolysis is a metabolic heirloom from early cells 
that continues to function in fermentation and as the first stage in the breakdown of organic molecules by respiration.</justification>

        <justification>The C4 plants are so named because they preface the Calvin cycle with an alternate mode of carbon fixation that forms a four-carbon compound as its first product. Several thousand species in at least 19 plant families use the C4 pathway. Among the C4 plants important to agriculture are sugarcane and corn, members of the grass family. Figure 10.20 C4 leaf anatomy and the C4 pathway. The structure and biochemical functions of the leaves of C4 plants are an evolutionary adaptation to hot, dry climates. This adaptation maintains a CO2 concentration in the bundle sheath that favors photosynthesis over photorespiration. A unique leaf anatomy is correlated with the mechanism of C4 photosynthesis (Figure 10.20; compare with Figure 10.4). In C4 plants, there are two distinct types of photosynthetic cells: bundle-sheath cells and mesophyll cells. Bundle-sheath cells are arranged into tightly packed sheaths around the veins of the leaf. Between the bundle sheath and the leaf surface are the more 
loosely arranged mesophyll cells. The Calvin cycle is confined to the chloroplasts of the bundle-sheath cells. However, the Calvin cycle is preceded by incorporation of CO2 into organic compounds in the mesophyll cells. See the numbered steps in Figure 10.20, which are also described here: The first step is carried out by an enzyme present only in mesophyll cells called PEP carboxylase. This enzyme adds CO2 to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), forming the four-carbon product oxaloacetate. PEP carboxylase has a much higher affinity for CO2 than does rubisco and no affinity for O2. Therefore, PEP carboxylase can fix carbon efficiently when rubisco cannot: that is, when it is hot and dry and stomata are partially closed, causing CO2 concentration in the leaf to fall and O2 concentration to rise. After the C4 plant fixes carbon from CO2, the mesophyll cells export their four-carbon products (malate in the example shown in Figure 10.20) to bundle-sheath cells through plasmodesmata (see Figure 6.31). Within the bundle-
sheath cells, the four-carbon compounds release CO2, which is reassimilated into organic material by rubisco and the Calvin cycle. The same reaction regenerates pyruvate, which is transported to mesophyll cells. There, ATP is used to convert pyruvate to PEP, allowing the reaction cycle to continue; this ATP can be thought of as the "price" of concentrating CO2 in the bundle-sheath cells. To generate this extra ATP, bundle-sheath cells carry out cyclic electron flow, the process described earlier in this chapter (see Figure 10.16). In fact, these cells contain PS I but no PS II, so cyclic electron flow is their only photosynthetic mode of generating ATP. In effect, the mesophyll cells of a C4 plant pump CO2 into the bundle sheath, keeping the CO2 concentration in the bundle-sheath cells high enough for rubisco to bind carbon dioxide rather than oxygen. The cyclic series of reactions involving PEP carboxylase and the regeneration of PEP can be thought of as a CO2-concentrating pump that is powered by ATP. In 
this way, C4 photosynthesis minimizes photorespiration and enhances sugar production. This adaptation is especially advantageous in hot regions with intense sunlight, where stomata partially close during the day, and it is in such environments that C4 plants evolved and thrive today. Since the Industrial Revolution began in the 1800s, human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels have drastically increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. The resulting global climate change, including an increase in average temperatures around the planet, may have far-reaching effects on plant species. Scientists are concerned that increasing CO2 concentration and temperature may affect C3 and C4 plants differently, thus changing the relative abundance of these species in a given plant community. Which type of plant would stand to gain more from increasing CO2 levels? Recall that in C3 plants, the binding of O2 rather than CO2 by rubisco leads to photorespiration, lowering the efficiency of photosynthesis. 
C4 plants overcome this problem by concentrating CO2 in the bundle-sheath cells at the cost of ATP. Rising CO2 levels should benefit C3 plants by lowering the amount of photorespiration that occurs. At the same time, rising temperatures have the opposite effect, increasing photorespiration. (Other factors such as water availability may also come into play. ) In contrast, many C4 plants could be largely unaffected by increasing CO2 levels or temperature. In different regions, the particular combination of these two factors is likely to alter the balance of C3 and C4 plants in varying ways. The effects of such a widespread and variable change in community structure are unpredictable and thus a cause of legitimate concern.</justification>

        <justification>A second photosynthetic adaptation to arid conditions has evolved in many succulent (water-storing) plants, numerous cacti, pineapples, and representatives of several other plant families. These plants open their stomata during the night and close them during the day, just the reverse of how other plants behave. Closing stomata during the day helps desert plants conserve water, but it also prevents CO2 from entering the leaves. During the night, when their stomata are open, these plants take up CO2 and incorporate it into a variety of organic acids. This mode of carbon fixation is called crassulacean acid metabolism, or CAM, after the plant family Crassulaceae, the succulents in which the process was first discovered. The mesophyll cells of CAM plants store the organic acids they make during the night in their vacuoles until morning, when the stomata close. During the day, when the light reactions can supply ATP and NADPH for the Calvin cycle, CO2 is released from the organic acids 
made the night before to become incorporated into sugar in the chloroplasts. Figure 10.21 C4 and CAM photosynthesis compared. Both adaptations are characterized by &amp;#x278A; preliminary incorporation of CO2 into organic acids, followed by &amp;#x278B; transfer of CO2 to the Calvin cycle. The C4 and CAM pathways are two evolutionary solutions to the problem of maintaining photosynthesis with stomata partially or completely closed on hot, dry days. Notice in Figure 10.21 that the CAM pathway is similar to the C4 pathway in that carbon dioxide is first incorporated into organic intermediates before it enters the Calvin cycle. The difference is that in C4 plants, the initial steps of carbon fixation are separated structurally from the Calvin cycle, whereas in CAM plants, the two steps occur at separate times but within the same cell. (Keep in mind that CAM, C4, and C3 plants all eventually use the Calvin cycle to make sugar from carbon dioxide. )</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Recall that the universe is really equivalent to "the system" plus "the surroundings. " In 1878, J. Willard Gibbs, a professor at Yale, defined a very useful function called the Gibbs free energy of a system (without considering its surroundings), symbolized by the letter G. We'll refer to the Gibbs free energy simply as free energy. Free energy is the portion of a system's energy that can perform work when temperature and pressure are uniform throughout the system, as in a living cell.</justification>

        <justification>As we saw in the previous section, when a process occurs spontaneously in a system, we can be sure that deltaG is negative. Another way to think of deltaG is to realize that it represents the difference between the free energy of the final state and the free energy of the initial state: deltaG = Gfinal state -' Ginitial state Thus, deltaG can be negative only when the process involves a loss of free energy during the change from initial state to final state. Because it has less free energy, the system in its final state is less likely to change and is therefore more stable than it was previously. Figure 8.5 The relationship of free energy to stability, work capacity, and spontaneous change. Unstable systems (top) are rich in free energy, G. They have a tendency to change spontaneously to a more stable state (bottom), and it is possible to harness this "downhill" change to perform work. We can think of free energy as a measure of a system's instability: its tendency to change to a more 
stable state. Unstable systems (higher G) tend to change in such a way that they become more stable (lower G). For example, a diver on top of a platform is less stable (more likely to fall) than when floating in the water; a drop of concentrated dye is less stable (more likely to disperse) than when the dye is spread randomly through the liquid; and a glucose molecule is less stable (more likely to break down) than the simpler molecules into which it can be split (Figure 8.5). Unless something prevents it, each of these systems will move toward greater stability: The diver falls, the solution becomes uniformly colored, and the glucose molecule is broken down. Another term that describes a state of maximum stability is equilibrium, which you learned about in Chapter 2 in connection with chemical reactions. There is an important relationship between free energy and equilibrium, including chemical equilibrium. Recall that most chemical reactions are reversible and proceed to a point at which the forward and 
backward reactions occur at the same rate. The reaction is then said to be at chemical equilibrium, and there is no further net change in the relative concentration of products and reactants. As a reaction proceeds toward equilibrium, the free energy of the mixture of reactants and products decreases. Free energy increases when a reaction is somehow pushed away from equilibrium, perhaps by removing some of the products (and thus changing their concentration relative to that of the reactants). For a system at equilibrium, G is at its lowest possible value in that system. We can think of the equilibrium state as a free-energy valley. Any change from the equilibrium position will have a positive deltaG and will not be spontaneous. For this reason, systems never spontaneously move away from equilibrium. Because a system at equilibrium cannot spontaneously change, it can do no work. A process is spontaneous and can perform work only when it is moving toward equilibrium.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 8.6 Free energy changes (deltaG) in exergonic and endergonic reactions. Based on their free-energy changes, chemical reactions can be classified as either exergonic ("energy outward") or endergonic ("energy inward"). An exergonic reaction proceeds with a net release of free energy (Figure 8.6a). Because the chemical mixture loses free energy (G decreases), deltaG is negative for an exergonic reaction. Using deltaG as a standard for spontaneity, exergonic reactions are those that occur spontaneously. (Remember, the word spontaneous implies that it is energetically favorable, not that it will occur rapidly. ) The magnitude of deltaG for an exergonic reaction represents the maximum amount of work the reaction can perform. The word maximum qualifies this statement, because some of the free energy is released as heat and cannot do work. Therefore, deltaG represents a theoretical upper limit of available energy. The greater the decrease in free energy, the greater the amount of work 
that can be done. We can use the overall reaction for cellular respiration as an example: C6H12O6 + 6 O2 -&gt;' 6 CO2 + 6 H2O deltaG = -'686 kcal/mol (-'2,870 kJ/mol) For each mole (180 g) of glucose broken down by respiration under what are called "standard conditions" (1 M of each reactant and product, 25 degree C, pH 7), 686 kcal (2,870 kJ) of energy are made available for work. Because energy must be conserved, the chemical products of respiration store 686 kcal less free energy per mole than the reactants. The products are, in a sense, the spent exhaust of a process that tapped the free energy stored in the bonds of the sugar molecules.</justification>

The energy stored in the organic molecules of food ultimately comes from the sun. Energy flows into an ecosystem as sunlight and exits as heat; in contrast, the chemical elements essential to life are recycled (Figure 9.2).

At the organismal level as well, complex and beautifully ordered structures result from biological processes that use simpler starting materials (Figure 8.4). However, an organism also takes in organized forms of matter and energy from the surroundings and replaces them with less ordered forms. For example, an animal obtains starch, proteins, and other complex molecules from the food it eats. As catabolic pathways break these molecules down, the animal releases carbon dioxide and water: small molecules that possess less chemical energy than the food did. The depletion of chemical energy is accounted for by heat generated during metabolism. On a larger scale,

      <answer>
        <justification>All cells have voltages across their plasma membranes. Voltage is electrical potential energy: a separation of opposite charges. The cytoplasmic side of the membrane is negative in charge relative to the extracellular side because of an unequal distribution of anions and cations on the two sides. The voltage across a membrane, called a membrane potential, ranges from about -'50 to -'200 millivolts (mV). (The minus sign indicates that the inside of the cell is negative relative to the outside. ) The membrane potential acts like a battery, an energy source that affects the traffic of all charged substances across the membrane. Because the inside of the cell is negative compared with the outside, the membrane potential favors the passive transport of cations into the cell and anions out of the cell. Thus, two forces drive the diffusion of ions across a membrane: a chemical force (the ion's concentration gradient) and an electrical force (the effect of the membrane potential on the ion's 
movement). This combination of forces acting on an ion is called the electrochemical gradient.</justification>

It is important, for example, in the sorting of cells into tissues and organs in an animal embryo. It is also the basis for the rejection of foreign cells by the immune system, an important line of defense in vertebrate animals (see Chapter 43). Cells recognize other cells by binding to molecules, often containing carbohydrates, on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane (see Figure 7.10d). Membrane carbohydrates are usually short, branched chains of fewer than 15 sugar units. Some are covalently bonded to lipids, forming molecules called glycolipids. (Recall that glyco refers to the presence of carbohydrate. ) However, most are covalently bonded to proteins, which are thereby glycoproteins (see Figure 7.5). The carbohydrates on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane vary from species to species, among individuals of the same 
species, and even from one cell type to another in a single individual. The diversity of the molecules and their location on the cell's surface enable membrane carbohydrates to function as markers that distinguish one cell from another.

    <text>Why do electrons have potential energy?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>An atom's electrons vary in the amount of energy they possess. Energy is defined as the capacity to cause change: for instance, by doing work. Potential energy is the energy that matter possesses because of its location or structure. For example, water in a reservoir on a hill has potential energy because of its altitude. When the gates of the reservoir's dam are opened and the water runs downhill, the energy can be used to do work, such as turning generators. Because energy has been expended, the water has less energy at the bottom of the hill than it did in the reservoir. Matter has a natural tendency to move to the lowest possible state of potential energy; in this example, the water runs downhill. To restore the potential energy of a reservoir, work must be done to elevate the water against gravity. Figure 2.8 Energy levels of an atom's electrons. Electrons exist only at fixed levels of potential energy called electron shells. The electrons of an atom have potential energy because 
of how they are arranged in relation to the nucleus. The negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positively charged nucleus. It takes work to move a given electron farther away from the nucleus, so the more distant an electron is from the nucleus, the greater its potential energy. Unlike the continuous flow of water downhill, changes in the potential energy of electrons can occur only in steps of fixed amounts. An electron having a certain amount of energy is something like a ball on a staircase (Figure 2.8a). The ball can have different amounts of potential energy, depending on which step it is on, but it cannot spend much time between the steps. Similarly, an electron's potential energy is determined by its energy level. An electron cannot exist between energy levels. An electron's energy level is correlated with its average distance from the nucleus. Electrons are found in different electron shells, each with a characteristic average distance and energy level. In diagrams, shells can be 
represented by concentric circles (Figure 2.8b). The first shell is closest to the nucleus, and electrons in this shell have the lowest potential energy. Electrons in the second shell have more energy, and electrons in the third shell even more energy. An electron can change the shell it occupies, but only by absorbing or losing an amount of energy equal to the difference in potential energy between its position in the old shell and that in the new shell. When an electron absorbs energy, it moves to a shell farther out from the nucleus. For example, light energy can excite an electron to a higher energy level. (Indeed, this is the first step taken when plants harness the energy of sunlight for photosynthesis, the process that produces food from carbon dioxide and water. ) When an electron loses energy, it "falls back" to a shell closer to the nucleus, and the lost energy is usually released to the environment as heat. For example, sunlight excites electrons in the surface of a car to higher energy levels. 
When the electrons fall back to their original levels, the car's surface heats up. This thermal energy can be transferred to the air or to your hand if you touch the car.</justification>

    <text>Why does the dye in the diffusion experiment diffuse from where it is more concentrated to where it is less concentrated?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Molecules have a type of energy called thermal energy (heat), due to their constant motion. One result of this motion is diffusion, the movement of molecules of any substance so that they spread out evenly into the available space. Each molecule moves randomly, yet diffusion of a population of molecules may be directional. To understand this process, let's imagine a synthetic membrane separating pure water from a solution of a dye in water. Study Figure 7.13a carefully to appreciate how diffusion would result in both solutions having equal concentrations of the dye molecules. Once that point is reached, there will be a dynamic equilibrium, with as many dye molecules crossing the membrane each second in one direction as in the other. We can now state a simple rule of diffusion: In the absence of other forces, a substance will diffuse from where it is more concentrated to where it is less concentrated. Put another way, any substance will diffuse down its concentration gradient, the 
region along which the density of a chemical substance increases or decreases (in this case, decreases). No work must be done to make this happen; diffusion is a spontaneous process, needing no input of energy. Note that each substance diffuses down its own concentration gradient, unaffected by the concentration gradients of other substances (Figure 7.13b).</justification>

    <text>Why does the plasma membrane become rigid at low temperatures?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>A membrane remains fluid as temperature decreases until finally the phospholipids settle into a closely packed arrangement and the membrane solidifies, much as bacon grease forms lard when it cools. The temperature at which a membrane solidifies depends on the types of lipids it is made of. The membrane remains fluid to a lower temperature if it is rich in phospholipids with unsaturated hydrocarbon tails (see Figures 5.11 and 5.12). Because of kinks in the tails where double bonds are located, unsaturated hydrocarbon tails cannot pack together as closely as saturated hydrocarbon tails, and this makes the membrane more fluid (Figure 7.8a).</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>We include glycolysis, however, because most respiring cells deriving energy from glucose use glycolysis to produce the starting material for the citric acid cycle. Figure 9.6 An overview of cellular respiration. During glycolysis, each glucose molecule is broken down into two molecules of the compound pyruvate. In eukaryotic cells, as shown here, the pyruvate enters the mitochondrion. There it is oxidized to acetyl CoA, which is further oxidized to CO2 in the citric acid cycle. NADH and a similar electron carrier, a coenzyme called FADH2, transfer electrons derived from glucose to electron transport chains, which are built into the inner mitochondrial membrane. (In prokaryotes, the electron transport chains are located in the plasma membrane. ) During oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport chains convert the chemical energy to a form used for ATP synthesis in the process called chemiosmosis. As diagrammed in Figure 9.6, glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation followed by the citric 
acid cycle are the catabolic pathways that break down glucose and other organic fuels. Glycolysis, which occurs in the cytosol, begins the degradation process by breaking glucose into two molecules of a compound called pyruvate. In eukaryotes, pyruvate enters the mitochondrion and is oxidized to a compound called acetyl CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle. There, the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide is completed. (In prokaryotes, these processes take place in the cytosol. ) Thus, the carbon dioxide produced by respiration represents fragments of oxidized organic molecules.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 9.10 Oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the step before the citric acid cycle. Pyruvate is a charged molecule, so in eukaryotic cells it must enter the mitochondrion via active transport, with the help of a transport protein. Next, a complex of several enzymes (the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) catalyzes the three numbered steps, which are described in the text. The acetyl group of acetyl CoA will enter the citric acid cycle. The CO2 molecule will diffuse out of the cell. By convention, coenzyme A is abbreviated S-CoA when it is attached to a molecule, emphasizing the sulfur atom (S). Upon entering the mitochondrion via active transport, pyruvate is first converted to a compound called acetyl coenzyme A, or acetyl CoA (Figure 9.10). This step, linking glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, is carried out by a multienzyme complex that catalyzes three reactions: &amp;#x278A; Pyruvate's carboxyl group (: COO-'), which is already fully oxidized and thus has little chemical energy,
 is removed and given off as a molecule of CO2. (This is the first step in which CO2 is released during respiration. ) &amp;#x278B; The remaining two-carbon fragment is oxidized, forming acetate (CH3COO-', the ionized form of acetic acid). The extracted electrons are transferred to NAD+, storing energy in the form of NADH. &amp;#x278C; Finally, coenzyme A (CoA), a sulfur-containing compound derived from a B vitamin, is attached via its sulfur atom to the acetate, forming acetyl CoA, which has a high potential energy; in other words, the reaction of acetyl CoA to yield lower-energy products is highly exergonic. This molecule will now feed its acetyl group into the citric acid cycle for further oxidation.</justification>

        <justification>Now let's look at the citric acid cycle in more detail. The cycle has eight steps, each catalyzed by a specific enzyme. You can see in Figure 9.12 that for each turn of the citric acid cycle, two carbons (red) enter in the relatively reduced form of an acetyl group (step 1), and two different carbons (blue) leave in the completely oxidized form of CO2 molecules (steps 3 and 4). The acetyl group of acetyl CoA joins the cycle by combining with the compound oxaloacetate, forming citrate (step 1). (Citrate is the ionized form of citric acid, for which the cycle is named. ) The next seven steps decompose the citrate back to oxaloacetate. It is this regeneration of oxaloacetate that makes this process a cycle.</justification>

On the cellular level, our muscle cells behave as facultative anaerobes. In such cells, pyruvate is a fork in the metabolic road that leads to two alternative catabolic routes (Figure 9.18). Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate can be converted to acetyl CoA, and oxidation continues in the citric acid cycle via aerobic respiration. Under anaerobic conditions, lactic acid fermentation occurs: Pyruvate is diverted from the citric acid cycle, serving instead as an electron acceptor to recycle NAD+.

        <justification>Catabolism can also harvest energy stored in fats obtained either from food or from storage cells in the body. After fats are digested to glycerol and fatty acids, the glycerol is converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an intermediate of glycolysis. Most of the energy of a fat is stored in the fatty acids. A metabolic sequence called beta oxidation breaks the fatty acids down to two-carbon fragments, which enter the citric acid cycle as acetyl CoA. NADH and FADH2 are also generated during beta oxidation; they can enter the electron transport chain, leading to further ATP production. Fats make excellent fuel, in large part due to their chemical structure and the high energy level of their electrons (equally shared between carbon and hydrogen) compared to those of carbohydrates. A gram of fat oxidized by respiration produces more than twice as much ATP as a gram of carbohydrate. Unfortunately, this also means that a person trying to lose weight must work hard to use up fat stored in 
the body because so many calories are stockpiled in each gram of fat.</justification>

        <justification>Let's look more closely at how water and certain hydrophilic solutes cross a membrane. As mentioned earlier, many polar molecules and ions impeded by the lipid bilayer of the membrane diffuse passively with the help of transport proteins that span the membrane. This phenomenon is called facilitated diffusion. Cell biologists are still trying to learn exactly how various transport proteins facilitate diffusion. Most transport proteins are very specific: They transport some substances but not others. Figure 7.17 Two types of transport proteins that carry out facilitated diffusion. In both cases, the protein can transport the solute in either direction, but the net movement is down the concentration gradient of the solute. As described earlier, the two types of transport proteins are channel proteins and carrier proteins. Channel proteins simply provide corridors that allow specific molecules or ions to cross the membrane (Figure 7.17a). The hydrophilic passageways provided by these 
proteins can allow water molecules or small ions to diffuse very quickly from one side of the membrane to the other. Aquaporins, the water channel proteins, facilitate the massive amounts of diffusion that occur in plant cells and in animal cells such as red blood cells (see Figure 7.15). Certain kidney cells also have a high number of aquaporins, allowing them to reclaim water from urine before it is excreted. If the kidneys did not perform this function, you would excrete about 180 L of urine per day: and have to drink an equal volume of water! Channel proteins that transport ions are called ion channels. Many ion channels function as gated channels, which open or close in response to a stimulus. For some gated channels, the stimulus is electrical. The ion channel shown in Figure 7.1, for example, opens in response to an electrical stimulus, allowing potassium ions to leave the cell. Other gated channels open or close when a specific substance other than the one to be transported binds to the channel. Both 
types of gated channels are important in the functioning of the nervous system, as you'll learn in Chapter 48. Carrier proteins, such as the glucose transporter mentioned earlier, seem to undergo a subtle change in shape that somehow translocates the solute-binding site across the membrane (Figure 7.17b). Such a change in shape may be triggered by the binding and release of the transported molecule. Like ion channels, carrier proteins involved in facilitated diffusion result in the net movement of a substance down its concentration gradient. No energy input is thus required: This is passive transport.</justification>

        <justification>All cells have voltages across their plasma membranes. Voltage is electrical potential energy: a separation of opposite charges. The cytoplasmic side of the membrane is negative in charge relative to the extracellular side because of an unequal distribution of anions and cations on the two sides. The voltage across a membrane, called a membrane potential, ranges from about -'50 to -'200 millivolts (mV). (The minus sign indicates that the inside of the cell is negative relative to the outside. ) The membrane potential acts like a battery, an energy source that affects the traffic of all charged substances across the membrane. Because the inside of the cell is negative compared with the outside, the membrane potential favors the passive transport of cations into the cell and anions out of the cell. Thus, two forces drive the diffusion of ions across a membrane: a chemical force (the ion's concentration gradient) and an electrical force (the effect of the membrane potential on the ion's 
movement). This combination of forces acting on an ion is called the electrochemical gradient. In the case of ions, then, we must refine our concept of passive transport: An ion diffuses not simply down its concentration gradient but, more exactly, down its electrochemical gradient. For example, the concentration of Na+ inside a resting nerve cell is much lower than outside it. When the cell is stimulated, gated channels open that facilitate Na+ diffusion. Sodium ions then "fall" down their electrochemical gradient, driven by the concentration gradient of Na+ and by the attraction of these cations to the negative side (inside) of the membrane. In this example, both electrical and chemical contributions to the electrochemical gradient act in the same direction across the membrane, but this is not always so.</justification>

Note that the hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids are in contact with water in this structure, whereas the hydrophobic tails are in contact with each other and remote from water. The two ends of phospholipids show different behavior toward water. The hydrocarbon tails are hydrophobic and are excluded from water. However, the phosphate group and its attachments form a hydrophilic head that has an affinity for water. When phospholipids are added to water, they self-assemble into double-layered structures called "bilayers," shielding their hydrophobic portions from water (Figure 5.13). At the surface of a cell, phospholipids are arranged in a similar bilayer. The hydrophilic heads of the molecules are on the outside of the bilayer, in contact with the aqueous solutions inside and outside of the cell. The hydrophobic tails point toward the interior of the bilayer, away from the water. The phospholipid 
bilayer forms a boundary between the cell and its external environment; in fact, cells could not exist without phospholipids.</justification>

        <justification>A sphere of water molecules, called a hydration shell, surrounds each solute ion. Suppose, for example, that a spoonful of table salt, the ionic compound sodium chloride (NaCl), is placed in water (Figure 3.7). At the surface of each grain, or crystal, of salt, the sodium and chloride ions are exposed to the solvent. These ions and the water molecules have a mutual affinity owing to the attraction between opposite charges. The oxygen regions of the water molecules are negatively charged and are attracted to sodium cations. The hydrogen regions are positively charged and are attracted to chloride anions. As a result, water molecules surround the individual sodium and chloride ions, separating and shielding them from one another. The sphere of water molecules around each dissolved ion is called a hydration shell. Working inward from the surface of each salt crystal, water eventually dissolves all the ions. The result is a solution of two solutes, sodium cations and chloride anions, 
homogeneously mixed with water, the solvent.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>What exactly happens when chlorophyll and other pigments absorb light? The colors corresponding to the absorbed wavelengths disappear from the spectrum of the transmitted and reflected light, but energy cannot disappear. When a molecule absorbs a photon of light, one of the molecule's electrons is elevated to an orbital where it has more potential energy. When the electron is in its normal orbital, the pigment molecule is said to be in its ground state. Absorption of a photon boosts an electron to an orbital of higher energy, and the pigment molecule is then said to be in an excited state. The only photons absorbed are those whose energy is exactly equal to the energy difference between the ground state and an excited state, and this energy difference varies from one kind of molecule to another. Thus, a particular compound absorbs only photons corresponding to specific wavelengths, which is why each pigment has a unique absorption spectrum.</justification>

These molecules are attractive drug candidates for enzyme regulation because they exhibit higher specificity for particular enzymes than do inhibitors that bind to the active site.

      <answer>
        <justification>A unique leaf anatomy is correlated with the mechanism of C4 photosynthesis (Figure 10.20; compare with Figure 10.4). In C4 plants, there are two distinct types of photosynthetic cells: bundle-sheath cells and mesophyll cells. Bundle-sheath cells are arranged into tightly packed sheaths around the veins of the leaf. Between the bundle sheath and the leaf surface are the more loosely arranged mesophyll cells. The Calvin cycle is confined to the chloroplasts of the bundle-sheath cells. However, the Calvin cycle is preceded by incorporation of CO2 into organic compounds in the mesophyll cells. See the numbered steps in Figure 10.20, which are also described here: The first step is carried out by an enzyme present only in mesophyll cells called PEP carboxylase. This enzyme adds CO2 to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), forming the four-carbon product oxaloacetate. PEP carboxylase has a much higher affinity for CO2 than does rubisco and no affinity for O2. Therefore, PEP carboxylase can fix carbon 
efficiently when rubisco cannot: that is, when it is hot and dry and stomata are partially closed, causing CO2 concentration in the leaf to fall and O2 concentration to rise.</justification>

However, because cholesterol also hinders the close packing of phospholipids, it lowers the temperature required for the membrane to solidify.

      <answer>
        <justification>Cell-cell recognition, a cell's ability to distinguish one type of neighboring cell from another, is crucial to the functioning of an organism. It is important, for example, in the sorting of cells into tissues and organs in an animal embryo. It is also the basis for the rejection of foreign cells by the immune system, an important line of defense in vertebrate animals (see Chapter 43). Cells recognize other cells by binding to molecules, often containing carbohydrates, on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane (see Figure 7.10d). Membrane carbohydrates are usually short, branched chains of fewer than 15 sugar units. Some are covalently bonded to lipids, forming molecules called glycolipids.

    <text>Why do reaction rates increase gradually as temperatures increase towards enzymes' optimal temperature values?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Recall from Chapter 5 that the three-dimensional structures of proteins are sensitive to their environment. As a consequence, each enzyme works better under some conditions than under other conditions, because these optimal conditions favor the most active shape for the enzyme molecule. Figure 8.16 Environmental factors affecting enzyme activity. Each enzyme has an optimal (a) temperature and (b) pH that favor the most active shape of the protein molecule. Temperature and pH are environmental factors important in the activity of an enzyme. Up to a point, the rate of an enzymatic reaction increases with increasing temperature, partly because substrates collide with active sites more frequently when the molecules move rapidly. Above that temperature, however, the speed of the enzymatic reaction drops sharply. The thermal agitation of the enzyme molecule disrupts the hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and other weak interactions that stabilize the active shape of the enzyme, and the protein 
molecule eventually denatures. Each enzyme has an optimal temperature at which its reaction rate is greatest. Without denaturing the enzyme, this temperature allows the greatest number of molecular collisions and the fastest conversion of the reactants to product molecules. Most human enzymes have optimal temperatures of about 35-40 degree C (close to human body temperature). The thermophilic bacteria that live in hot springs contain enzymes with optimal temperatures of 70 degree C or higher (Figure 8.16a on the next page).</justification>

        <justification>EVOLUTION Variations in the cell membrane lipid compositions of many species appear to be evolutionary adaptations that maintain the appropriate membrane fluidity under specific environmental conditions. For instance, fishes that live in extreme cold have membranes with a high proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbon tails, enabling their membranes to remain fluid (see Figure 7.8a). At the other extreme, some bacteria and archaea thrive at temperatures greater than 90 degree C (194 degree F) in thermal hot springs and geysers. Their membranes include unusual lipids that may prevent excessive fluidity at such high temperatures. The ability to change the lipid composition of cell membranes in response to changing temperatures has evolved in organisms that live where temperatures vary. In many plants that tolerate extreme cold, such as winter wheat, the percentage of unsaturated phospholipids increases in autumn, an adjustment that keeps the membranes from solidifying during winter. Certain 
bacteria and archaea can also change the proportion of unsaturated phospholipids in their cell membranes, depending on the temperature at which they are growing. Overall, natural selection has apparently favored organisms whose mix of membrane lipids ensures an appropriate level of membrane fluidity for their environment.</justification>

At temperatures this high, the cells of most organisms die because, for example, their DNA does not remain in a double helix and many of their proteins denature. Sulfolobus and other extreme thermophiles avoid this fate because their DNA and proteins have adaptations that make them stable at high temperatures. One extreme thermophile that lives near deep-sea hot springs called hydrothermal vents is informally known as "strain 121," since it can reproduce even at 121 degree C.

        <justification>Figure 7.21 Cotransport: active transport driven by a concentration gradient. A carrier protein, such as this sucrose-H+ cotransporter in a plant cell, is able to use the diffusion of H+ down its electrochemical gradient into the cell to drive the uptake of sucrose. The H+ gradient is maintained by an ATP-driven proton pump that concentrates H+ outside the cell, thus storing potential energy that can be used for active transport, in this case of sucrose. Thus, ATP indirectly provides the energy necessary for cotransport. (The cell wall is not shown. ) A single ATP-powered pump that transports a specific solute can indirectly drive the active transport of several other solutes in a mechanism called cotransport. A substance that has been pumped across a membrane can do work as it moves back across the membrane by diffusion, analogous to water that has been pumped uphill and performs work as it flows back down. Another transport protein, a cotransporter separate from the pump, can couple 
the "downhill" diffusion of this substance to the "uphill" transport of a second substance against its own concentration (or electrochemical) gradient. For example, a plant cell uses the gradient of H+ generated by its proton pumps to drive the active transport of amino acids, sugars, and several other nutrients into the cell. One transport protein couples the return of H+ to the transport of sucrose into the cell (Figure 7.21). This protein can translocate sucrose into the cell against a concentration gradient, but only if the sucrose molecule travels in the company of a hydrogen ion. The hydrogen ion uses the transport protein as an avenue to diffuse down the electrochemical gradient maintained by the proton pump. Plants use sucrose-H+ cotransport to load sucrose produced by photosynthesis into cells in the veins of leaves. The vascular tissue of the plant can then distribute the sugar to nonphotosynthetic organs, such as roots.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 36.7 Solute transport across plant cell plasma membranes. Hydrogen ions (H+), rather than sodium ions (Na+), play the primary role in basic transport processes in plant cells. For example, in plant cells the membrane potential (the voltage across the membrane) is established mainly through the pumping of H+ by proton pumps (Figure 36.7a), rather than the pumping of Na+ by sodium-potassium pumps. Also, H+ is most often cotransported in plants, whereas Na+ is typically cotransported in animals. During cotransport, plant cells use the energy in the H+ gradient and membrane potential to drive the active transport of many different solutes. For instance, cotransport with H+ is responsible for absorption of neutral solutes, such as the sugar sucrose, by phloem cells and other plant cells. An H+/sucrose cotransporter couples movement of sucrose against its concentration gradient with movement of H+ down its electrochemical gradient (Figure 36.7b). Cotransport with H+ also facilitates 
movement of ions, as in the uptake of nitrate (NO3-') by root cells (Figure 36.7c).</justification>

    <text>Why can a single enzyme only work on a few or only one substrates?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>The reaction catalyzed by each enzyme is very specific; an enzyme can recognize its specific substrate even among closely related compounds. For instance, sucrase will act only on sucrose and will not bind to other disaccharides, such as maltose. What accounts for this molecular recognition? Recall that most enzymes are proteins, and proteins are macromolecules with unique three-dimensional configurations. The specificity of an enzyme results from its shape, which is a consequence of its amino acid sequence. Figure 8.14 Induced fit between an enzyme and its substrate. Only a restricted region of the enzyme molecule actually binds to the substrate. This region, called the active site, is typically a pocket or groove on the surface of the enzyme where catalysis occurs (Figure 8.14a). Usually, the active site is formed by only a few of the enzyme's amino acids, with the rest of the protein molecule providing a framework that determines the configuration of the active site. The specificity 
of an enzyme is attributed to a compatible fit between the shape of its active site and the shape of the substrate. An enzyme is not a stiff structure locked into a given shape. In fact, recent work by biochemists has shown clearly that enzymes (and other proteins as well) seem to "dance" between subtly different shapes in a dynamic equilibrium, with slight differences in free energy for each "pose. " The shape that best fits the substrate isn't necessarily the one with the lowest energy, but during the very short time the enzyme takes on this shape, its active site can bind to the substrate. It has been known for more than 50 years that the active site itself is also not a rigid receptacle for the substrate. As the substrate enters the active site, the enzyme changes shape slightly due to interactions between the substrate's chemical groups and chemical groups on the side chains of the amino acids that form the active site. This shape change makes the active site fit even more snugly around the substrate (
Figure 8.14b). This induced fit is like a clasping handshake. Induced fit brings chemical groups of the active site into positions that enhance their ability to catalyze the chemical reaction.</justification>

        <justification>The plasma membrane is the edge of life, the boundary that separates the living cell from its surroundings. A remarkable film only about 8 nm thick: it would take over 8,000 plasma membranes to equal the thickness of this page: the plasma membrane controls traffic into and out of the cell it surrounds. Like all biological membranes, the plasma membrane exhibits selective permeability; that is, it allows some substances to cross it more easily than others. One of the earliest episodes in the evolution of life may have been the formation of a membrane that enclosed a solution different from the surrounding solution while still permitting the uptake of nutrients and elimination of waste products. The ability of the cell to discriminate in its chemical exchanges with its environment is fundamental to life, and it is the plasma membrane and its component molecules that make this selectivity possible. Figure 7.1 How do cell membrane proteins help regulate chemical traffic? In this chapter, 
you will learn how cellular membranes control the passage of substances. The image in Figure 7.1 shows the elegant structure of a eukaryotic plasma membrane protein that plays a crucial role in nerve cell signaling. This protein provides a channel for a stream of potassium ions (K+) to exit a nerve cell at a precise moment after nerve stimulation, restoring the cell's ability to fire again. (The orange ball in the center represents one potassium ion moving through the channel. ) In this way, the plasma membrane and its proteins not only act as an outer boundary but also enable the cell to carry out its functions. The same applies to the many varieties of internal membranes that partition the eukaryotic cell: The molecular makeup of each membrane allows compartmentalized specialization in cells. To understand how membranes work, we'll begin by examining their architecture.</justification>

        <justification>The biological membrane is an exquisite example of a supramolecular structure: many molecules ordered into a higher level of organization: with emergent properties beyond those of the individual molecules. The remainder of this chapter focuses on one of the most important of those properties: the ability to regulate transport across cellular boundaries, a function essential to the cell's existence. We will see once again that form fits function: The fluid mosaic model helps explain how membranes regulate the cell's molecular traffic. A steady traffic of small molecules and ions moves across the plasma membrane in both directions. Consider the chemical exchanges between a muscle cell and the extracellular fluid that bathes it. Sugars, amino acids, and other nutrients enter the cell, and metabolic waste products leave it. The cell takes in O2 for use in cellular respiration and expels CO2. Also, the cell regulates its concentrations of inorganic ions, such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl-', by 
shuttling them one way or the other across the plasma membrane. In spite of heavy traffic through them, cell membranes are selectively permeable, and substances do not cross the barrier indiscriminately. The cell is able to take up some small molecules and ions and exclude others. Also, substances that move through the membrane do so at different rates.</justification>

However, the hydrophobic interior of the membrane impedes the direct passage of ions and polar molecules, which are hydrophilic, through the membrane. Polar molecules such as glucose and other sugars pass only slowly through a lipid bilayer, and even water, an extremely small polar molecule, does not cross very rapidly. A charged atom or molecule and its surrounding shell of water (see Figure 3.7) find the hydrophobic interior of the membrane even more difficult to penetrate. Furthermore, the lipid bilayer is only one aspect of the gatekeeper system responsible for the selective permeability of a cell.

      <answer>
        <justification>Cell membranes are permeable to specific ions and a variety of polar molecules. These hydrophilic substances can avoid contact with the lipid bilayer by passing through transport proteins that span the membrane. Some transport proteins, called channel proteins, function by having a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or atomic ions use as a tunnel through the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, left). For example, the passage of water molecules through the membrane in certain cells is greatly facilitated by channel proteins known as aquaporins. Each aquaporin allows entry of up to 3 billion (3 * 109) water molecules per second, passing single file through its central channel, which fits ten at a time. Without aquaporins, only a tiny fraction of these water molecules would pass through the same area of the cell membrane in a second, so the channel protein brings about a tremendous increase in rate. Other transport proteins, called carrier proteins, hold onto their passengers and change 
shape in a way that shuttles them across the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, right). A transport protein is specific for the substance it translocates (moves), allowing only a certain substance (or a small group of related substances) to cross the membrane. For example, a specific carrier protein in the plasma membrane of red blood cells transports glucose across the membrane 50,000 times faster than glucose can pass through on its own. This "glucose transporter" is so selective that it even rejects fructose, a structural isomer of glucose. Thus, the selective permeability of a membrane depends on both the discriminating barrier of the lipid bilayer and the specific transport proteins built into the membrane.</justification>

    <text>Why is photorespiration wasteful?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>In most plants, initial fixation of carbon occurs via rubisco, the Calvin cycle enzyme that adds CO2 to ribulose bisphosphate. Such plants are called C3 plants because the first organic product of carbon fixation is a three-carbon compound, 3-phosphoglycerate (see Figure 10.19). Rice, wheat, and soybeans are C3 plants that are important in agriculture. When their stomata partially close on hot, dry days, C3 plants produce less sugar because the declining level of CO2 in the leaf starves the Calvin cycle. In addition, rubisco can bind O2 in place of CO2. As CO2 becomes scarce within the air spaces of the leaf, rubisco adds O2 to the Calvin cycle instead of CO2. The product splits, and a two-carbon compound leaves the chloroplast. Peroxisomes and mitochondria rearrange and split this compound, releasing CO2. The process is called photorespiration because it occurs in the light (photo) and consumes O2 while producing CO2 (respiration). However, unlike normal cellular respiration, 
photorespiration generates no ATP; in fact, photorespiration consumes ATP. And unlike photosynthesis, photorespiration produces no sugar. In fact, photorespiration decreases photosynthetic output by siphoning organic material from the Calvin cycle and releasing CO2 that would otherwise be fixed.</justification>

    <text>Why is it rare for a female to be affected by an X-linked recessive disease?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>X-linked genes in humans follow the same pattern of inheritance that Morgan observed for the eye-color locus he studied in Drosophila (see Figure 15.4). Fathers pass X-linked alleles to all of their daughters but to none of their sons. In contrast, mothers can pass X-linked alleles to both sons and daughters, as shown in Figure 15.7. If an X-linked trait is due to a recessive allele, a female will express the phenotype only if she is homozygous for that allele. Because males have only one locus, the terms homozygous and heterozygous lack meaning for describing their X-linked genes; the term hemizygous is used in such cases. Any male receiving the recessive allele from his mother will express the trait. For this reason, far more males than females have X-linked recessive disorders. However, even though the chance of a female inheriting a double dose of the mutant allele is much less than the probability of a male inheriting a single dose, there are females with X-linked disorders.</justification>

        <justification>In humans, the first sites used for energy storage are liver and muscle cells. In these cells, excess energy from the diet is stored in glycogen, a polymer made up of many glucose units (see Figure 5.6b). Once glycogen depots are full, any additional excess energy is usually stored in fat in adipose cells. When fewer calories are taken in than are expended: perhaps because of sustained heavy exercise or lack of food: the human body generally expends liver glycogen first and then draws on muscle glycogen and fat. Fats are especially rich in energy; oxidizing a gram of fat liberates about twice the energy liberated from a gram of carbohydrate or protein. For this reason, adipose tissue provides the most space-efficient way for the body to store large amounts of energy. Most healthy people have enough stored fat to sustain them through several weeks without food.</justification>

        <justification>Experimental deforestation of a watershed dramatically increased the flow of water and minerals leaving the watershed (Figure 55.16b and c). Over three years, water runoff from the newly deforested watershed was 30-40% greater than in a control watershed, apparently because there were no plants to absorb and transpire water from the soil. The concentration of Ca2+ in the creek increased 4-fold, and the concentration of K+ increased by a factor of 15. Most remarkable was the loss of nitrate, whose concentration in the creek increased 60-fold, reaching levels considered unsafe for drinking water (Figure 55.16c). The Hubbard Brook deforestation study showed that the amount of nutrients leaving an intact forest ecosystem is controlled mainly by the plants. Retaining nutrients in ecosystems helps to maintain the productivity of the systems and, in some cases, to avoid problems cause by excess nutrient runoff (see Figure 55.8).</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>In meiosis in humans, an average of one to three crossover events occur per chromosome pair, depending on the size of the chromosomes and the position of their centromeres. Crossing over begins very early in prophase I as homologous chromosomes pair loosely along their lengths. Each gene on one homolog is aligned precisely with the corresponding gene on the other homolog. In a single crossover event, the DNA of two nonsister chromatids: one maternal and one paternal chromatid of a homologous pair: is broken by specific proteins at precisely corresponding points, and the two segments beyond the crossover point are each joined to the other chromatid. Thus, a paternal chromatid is joined to a piece of maternal chromatid beyond the crossover point, and vice versa. In this way, crossing over produces chromosomes with new combinations of maternal and paternal alleles (see Figure 13.11).</justification>

        <justification>More than light, nutrients limit primary production in most oceans and lakes. A limiting nutrient is the element that must be added for production to increase. The nutrient most often limiting marine production is either nitrogen or phosphorus. Concentrations of these nutrients are typically low in the photic zone because they are rapidly taken up by phytoplankton and because detritus tends to sink. As detailed in Figure 55.8, nutrient enrichment experiments confirmed that nitrogen was limiting phytoplankton growth off the south shore of Long Island, New York. One practical application of this work is in preventing algal "blooms" caused by excess nitrogen runoff that fertilizes the phytoplankton. Prior to this research, phosphate contamination was thought to cause many such blooms in the ocean, but eliminating phosphates alone may not help unless nitrogen pollution is also controlled.</justification>

        <justification>In general, stomata are open during the day and mostly closed at night, preventing the plant from losing water under conditions when photosynthesis cannot occur. At least three cues contribute to stomatal opening at dawn: light, CO2 depletion, and an internal "clock" in guard cells. The light stimulates guard cells to accumulate K+ and become turgid. This response is triggered by illumination of blue-light receptors in the plasma membrane of guard cells. Activation of these receptors stimulates the activity of proton pumps in the plasma membrane of the guard cells, in turn promoting absorption of K+. The stomata also open in response to depletion of CO2 within the leaf's air spaces as a result of photosynthesis. As CO2 concentrations decrease during the day, the stomata progressively open if sufficient water is supplied to the leaf.</justification>

        <justification>Coordinate control of dispersed genes in a eukaryotic cell often occurs in response to chemical signals from outside the cell. A steroid hormone, for example, enters a cell and binds to a specific intracellular receptor protein, forming a hormone-receptor complex that serves as a transcription activator (see Figure 11.9). Every gene whose transcription is stimulated by a particular steroid hormone, regardless of its chromosomal location, has a control element recognized by that hormone-receptor complex.

        <justification>Figure 45.8 Steroid hormone receptors directly regulate gene expression. Steroid hormone receptors are located in the cytosol prior to binding to a hormone. When a steroid hormone binds to its cytosolic receptor, a hormone-receptor complex forms, which moves into the nucleus. There, the receptor portion of the complex alters transcription of particular genes by interacting with a specific DNA-binding protein or response element in the DNA (see Figure 18.9). Consider, for example, estrogens, steroid hormones necessary for female reproductive function in vertebrates. In female birds and frogs, estradiol, a form of estrogen, has a specific receptor in liver cells. Binding of estradiol to this receptor activates transcription of the gene for the protein vitellogenin (Figure 45.8).

    <text>Why are conformational changes due to ATP hydrolysis so important?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 8.10 How ATP drives transport and mechanical work. ATP hydrolysis causes changes in the shapes and binding affinities of proteins. This can occur either (a) directly, by phosphorylation, as shown for a membrane protein carrying out active transport of a solute (see also Figure 7.18), or (b) indirectly, via noncovalent binding of ATP and its hydrolytic products, as is the case for motor proteins that move vesicles (and other organelles) along cytoskeletal "tracks" in the cell (see also Figure 6.21). Transport and mechanical work in the cell are also nearly always powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. In these cases, ATP hydrolysis leads to a change in a protein's shape and often its ability to bind another molecule. Sometimes this occurs via a phosphorylated intermediate, as seen for the transport protein in Figure 8.10a. In most instances of mechanical work involving motor proteins "walking" along cytoskeletal elements (Figure 8.10b), a cycle occurs in which ATP is first bound 
noncovalently to the motor protein. Next, ATP is hydrolyzed, releasing ADP and &amp;#9413;i. Another ATP molecule can then bind. At each stage, the motor protein changes its shape and ability to bind the cytoskeleton, resulting in movement of the protein along the cytoskeletal track.</justification>

        <justification>This side view of the brain indicates the position of the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the pineal gland. (The pineal gland plays a role in regulating biorhythm. ) In vertebrates, the hypothalamus plays a central role in integrating the endocrine and nervous systems. One of several endocrine glands located in the brain (Figure 45.14), the hypothalamus receives information from nerves throughout the body, including the brain. In response, the hypothalamus initiates endocrine signaling appropriate to environmental conditions. In many vertebrates, for example, nerve signals from the brain pass sensory information to the hypothalamus about seasonal changes. The hypothalamus, in turn, regulates the release of reproductive hormones required during the breeding season. Signals from the hypothalamus travel to the pituitary gland, a gland located at its base (see Figure 45.14). Roughly the size and shape of a lima bean, the pituitary has discrete posterior and anterior parts, or lobes, 
that secrete different sets of hormones. The posterior pituitary is an extension of the hypothalamus. Hypothalamic axons that reach into the posterior pituitary secrete neurohormones synthesized in the hypothalamus. In contrast, the anterior pituitary is an endocrine gland that synthesizes and secretes hormones in response to signals from the hypothalamus.</justification>

        <justification>The walls of arteries and veins have a more complex organization than those of capillaries. Both arteries and veins have two layers of tissue surrounding the endothelium: an outer layer of connective tissue containing elastic fibers, which allow the vessel to stretch and recoil, and a middle layer containing smooth muscle and more elastic fibers. However, the walls of arteries and veins also differ, reflecting distinct adaptations of these vessels to their particular functions in circulation. The walls of arteries are thick and strong, accommodating blood pumped at high pressure by the heart. Arterial walls also have an elastic recoil that helps maintain blood pressure and flow to capillaries when the heart relaxes between contractions. Signals from the nervous system and hormones circulating in the blood act on the smooth muscle in arteries and arterioles, dilating or constricting these vessels and thus controlling blood flow to different parts of the body. Because veins convey blood 
back to the heart at a lower pressure, they do not require thick walls. For a given blood vessel diameter, a vein has a wall only about a third as thick as that of an artery.</justification>

        <justification>Endocrine signals generated by the hypothalamus regulate hormone secretion by the anterior pituitary (Figure 45.16). Each hypothalamic hormone is either a releasing hormone or an inhibiting hormone, reflecting its role in promoting or inhibiting release of one or more specific hormones by the anterior pituitary. Prolactin-releasing hormone, for example, is a hypothalamic hormone that stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete prolactin, which has activities that include stimulating milk production. Every anterior pituitary hormone is controlled by at least one releasing hormone. Some, such as prolactin, have both a releasing hormone and an inhibiting hormone. The hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones are secreted near capillaries at the base of the hypothalamus. The capillaries drain into short blood vessels, called portal vessels, which subdivide into a second capillary bed within the anterior pituitary. In this way, the releasing and inhibiting hormones have direct access 
to the gland they control. Hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary regulate a diverse set of processes in the human body, including metabolism, osmoregulation, and reproductive activity.</justification>

        <justification>Growth hormone (GH), which is secreted by the anterior pituitary, stimulates growth through both tropic and nontropic effects. A major target, the liver, responds to GH by releasing insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which circulate in the blood and directly stimulate bone and cartilage growth. (IGFs also appear to play a key role in aging in many animal species. ) In the absence of GH, the skeleton of an immature animal stops growing. GH also exerts diverse metabolic effects that tend to raise blood glucose levels, thus opposing the effects of insulin. Abnormal production of GH in humans can result in several disorders, depending on when the problem occurs and whether it involves hypersecretion (too much) or hyposecretion (too little).</justification>

Stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to secrete a releasing hormone that stimulates the anterior pituitary to release the tropic hormone ACTH.

        <justification>Often, anterior pituitary hormones act in a cascade. In the case of thyrotropin, or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), TSH secretion is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TSH in turn induces the thyroid gland to secrete thyroid hormone, a combination of the iodine-containing hormones T3 and T4. Thyroid hormone stimulates metabolism and influences development and maturation. Hormones sometimes acquire distinct roles in different species over the course of evolution. Prolactin stimulates milk production in mammals but has diverse effects in different vertebrates. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) influences skin pigmentation in some vertebrates and fat metabolism in mammals. Although prolactin and MSH act on nonendocrine targets, most anterior pituitary hormones are tropic, acting on endocrine tissues or glands to regulate hormone secretion. Tropic hormones of the anterior pituitary include TSH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Growth hormone (GH) has both tropic and nontropic effects. It promotes growth directly, has diverse metabolic effects, and stimulates the production of growth factors by other tissues.</justification>

        <justification>In both male and female humans, the coordinated actions of hormones from the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, and gonads govern reproduction. The hypothalamus secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which then directs the anterior pituitary to secrete the gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (see Figure 45.16). These two hormones regulate gametogenesis directly, by targeting tissues in the gonads, as well as indirectly, by regulating sex hormone production. The principal sex hormones are steroid hormones: in males, androgens, especially testosterone; in females, estrogens, especially estradiol, and progesterone.

    <text>Why can't natural selection optimize all traits to make an organism perfectly adapted to its environment?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Though natural selection leads to adaptation, nature abounds with examples of organisms that are less than ideally "engineered" for their lifestyles. There are several reasons why. Selection can act only on existing variations. Natural selection favors only the fittest phenotypes among those currently in the population, which may not be the ideal traits. New advantageous alleles do not arise on demand. Evolution is limited by historical constraints. Each species has a legacy of descent with modification from ancestral forms. Evolution does not scrap the ancestral anatomy and build each new complex structure from scratch; rather, evolution co-opts existing structures and adapts them to new situations. We could imagine that if a terrestrial animal were to adapt to an environment in which flight would be advantageous, it might be best just to grow an extra pair of limbs that would serve as wings. However, evolution does not work this way; instead, it operates on the traits an organism 
already has. Thus, in birds and bats, an existing pair of limbs took on new functions for flight as these organisms evolved from nonflying ancestors. Adaptations are often compromises. Figure 23.19 Evolutionary compromise. The loud call that enables a Tungara frog to attract mates also attracts more dangerous characters in the neighborhood: in this case, a bat about to seize a meal. Each organism must do many different things. A seal spends part of its time on rocks; it could probably walk better if it had legs instead of flippers, but then it would not swim nearly as well. We humans owe much of our versatility and athleticism to our prehensile hands and flexible limbs, but these also make us prone to sprains, torn ligaments, and dislocations: Structural reinforcement has been compromised for agility. Figure 23.19 depicts another example of evolutionary compromise. Chance, natural selection, and the environment interact. Chance events can affect the subsequent evolutionary history of populations. For 
instance, when a storm blows insects or birds hundreds of kilometers over an ocean to an island, the wind does not necessarily transport those individuals that are best suited to the new environment. Thus, not all alleles present in the founding population's gene pool are better suited to the new environment than the alleles that are "left behind. " In addition, the environment at a particular location may change unpredictably from year to year, again limiting the extent to which adaptive evolution results in a close match between the organism and current environmental conditions. With these four constraints, evolution does not tend to craft perfect organisms. Natural selection operates on a "better than" basis. We can, in fact, see evidence for evolution in the many imperfections of the organisms it produces.</justification>

As you know, a permanent change in the DNA sequence is called a mutation. As you'll learn in Chapter 17, mutations can change the phenotype of an organism. And if they occur in germ cells (which give rise to gametes), mutations can be passed on from generation to generation. The vast majority of such changes are harmful, but a very small percentage can be beneficial. In either case, mutations are the source of the variation on which natural selection operates during evolution and are ultimately responsible for the appearance of new species.</justification>

        <justification>15.4 Alterations of chromosome number or structure cause some genetic disorders (pp. 297-300) Aneuploidy, an abnormal chromosome number, can result from nondisjunction during meiosis. When a normal gamete unites with one containing two copies or no copies of a particular chromosome, the resulting zygote and its descendant cells either have one extra copy of that chromosome (trisomy, 2n + 1) or are missing a copy (monosomy, 2n -' 1). Polyploidy (more than two complete sets of chromosomes) can result from complete nondisjunction during gamete formation. Chromosome breakage can result in alterations of chromosome structure: deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. Translocations can be reciprocal or nonreciprocal. Changes in the number of chromosomes per cell or in the structure of individual chromosomes can affect the phenotype and, in some cases, lead to human disorders. Such alterations cause Down syndrome (usually due to trisomy of chromosome 21), certain cancers 
associated with chromosomal translocations, and various other human disorders.</justification>

The superscript N represents the dominant allele for normal color vision carried on the X chromosome, and the superscript n represents the recessive allele, which has a mutation causing color blindness. White boxes indicate unaffected individuals, light orange boxes indicate carriers, and dark orange boxes indicate color-blind individuals. While most Y-linked genes help determine sex, the X chromosomes have genes for many characters unrelated to sex. X-linked genes in humans follow the same pattern of inheritance that Morgan observed for the eye-color locus he studied in Drosophila (see Figure 15.4). Fathers pass X-linked alleles to all of their daughters but to none of their sons. In contrast, mothers can pass X-linked alleles to both sons and daughters, as shown in Figure 15.7. If an X-linked trait is due to a recessive allele, a female will express the phenotype only if 
she is homozygous for that allele. Because males have only one locus, the terms homozygous and heterozygous lack meaning for describing their X-linked genes; the term hemizygous is used in such cases. Any male receiving the recessive allele from his mother will express the trait. For this reason, far more males than females have X-linked recessive disorders.</justification>

Dominant alleles that cause a lethal disease are much less common than recessive alleles that have lethal effects. All lethal alleles arise by mutations (changes to the DNA) in cells that produce sperm or eggs; presumably, such mutations are equally likely to be recessive or dominant. A lethal recessive allele can be passed from one generation to the next by heterozygous carriers because the carriers themselves have normal phenotypes.

        <justification>Because most of the ATP generated by cellular respiration is due to the work of oxidative phosphorylation, our estimate of ATP yield from aerobic respiration is contingent on an adequate supply of oxygen to the cell. Without the electronegative oxygen to pull electrons down the transport chain, oxidative phosphorylation eventually ceases. However, there are two general mechanisms by which certain cells can oxidize organic fuel and generate ATP without the use of oxygen: anaerobic respiration and fermentation. The distinction between these two is that an electron transport chain is used in anaerobic respiration but not in fermentation. (The electron transport chain is also called the respiratory chain because of its role in both types of cellular respiration. ) We have already mentioned anaerobic respiration, which takes place in certain prokaryotic organisms that live in environments without oxygen. These organisms have an electron transport chain but do not use oxygen as a final 
electron acceptor at the end of the chain. Oxygen performs this function very well because it is extremely electronegative, but other, less electronegative substances can also serve as final electron acceptors.</justification>

        <justification>In cellular respiration, by contrast, electrons carried by NADH are transferred to an electron transport chain, where they move stepwise down a series of redox reactions to a final electron acceptor. In aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is oxygen; in anaerobic respiration, the final acceptor is another molecule that is electronegative (although invariably less so than oxygen). Passage of electrons from NADH to the electron transport chain not only regenerates the NAD+ required for glycolysis but pays an ATP bonus when the stepwise electron transport from this NADH to oxygen drives oxidative phosphorylation.</justification>

        <justification>9.5 Fermentation and anaerobic respiration enable cells to produce ATP without the use of oxygen (pp. 177-179) Glycolysis nets 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation, whether oxygen is present or not. Under anaerobic conditions, either anaerobic respiration or fermentation can take place. In anaerobic respiration, an electron transport chain is present with a final electron acceptor other than oxygen. In fermentation, the electrons from NADH are passed to pyruvate or a derivative of pyruvate, regenerating the NAD+ required to oxidize more glucose. Two common types of fermentation are alcohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation. Fermentation and anaerobic or aerobic respiration all use glycolysis to oxidize glucose, but they differ in their final electron acceptor and whether an electron transport chain is used (respiration) or not (fermentation). Respiration yields more ATP; aerobic respiration, with O2 as the final electron acceptor, yields about 16 times as much ATP as does 
fermentation.</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Using the human heart as an example, let's now take a closer look at how the mammalian heart works (Figure 42.7). Located behind the sternum (breastbone), the human heart is about the size of a clenched fist and consists mostly of cardiac muscle (see Figure 40.5). The two atria have relatively thin walls and serve as collection chambers for blood returning to the heart from the lungs or other body tissues. Much of the blood that enters the atria flows into the ventricles while all heart chambers are relaxed. The remainder is transferred by contraction of the atria before the ventricles begin to contract. The ventricles have thicker walls and contract much more forcefully than the atria: especially the left ventricle, which pumps blood to all body organs through the systemic circuit. Although the left ventricle contracts with greater force than the right ventricle, it pumps the same volume of blood as the right ventricle during each contraction.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 24.2 The biological species concept is based on the potential to interbreed rather than on physical similarity. The primary definition of species used in this textbook is the biological species concept. According to this concept, a species is a group of populations whose members have the potential to interbreed in nature and produce viable, fertile offspring: but do not produce viable, fertile offspring with members of other such groups (Figure 24.2). Thus, the members of a biological species are united by being reproductively compatible, at least potentially. All human beings, for example, belong to the same species. A businesswoman in Manhattan may be unlikely to meet a dairy farmer in Mongolia, but if the two should happen to meet and mate, they could have viable babies that develop into fertile adults. In contrast, humans and chimpanzees remain distinct biological species even where they share territory, because many factors keep them from interbreeding and producing fertile 
offspring.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 42.18 Blood clotting. The occasional cut or scrape is not life-threatening because blood components seal the broken blood vessels. A break in a blood vessel wall exposes proteins that attract platelets and initiate coagulation, the conversion of liquid components of blood to a solid clot. The coagulant, or sealant, circulates in an inactive form called fibrinogen. In response to a broken blood vessel, platelets release clotting factors that trigger reactions leading to the formation of thrombin, an enzyme that converts fibrinogen to fibrin. Newly formed fibrin aggregates into threads that form the framework of the clot. Thrombin also activates a factor that catalyzes the formation of more thrombin, driving clotting to completion through positive feedback (see Chapter 40). The steps in the production of a blood clot are diagrammed in Figure 42.18. Any genetic mutation that blocks a step in the clotting process can cause hemophilia, a disease characterized by excessive bleeding

      <answer>
        <justification>The most common mechanism for this control is feedback inhibition: The end product of the anabolic pathway inhibits the enzyme that catalyzes an early step of the pathway (see Figure 8.21). This prevents the needless diversion of key metabolic intermediates from uses that are more urgent. Figure 9.20 The control of cellular respiration. Allosteric enzymes at certain points in the respiratory pathway respond to inhibitors and activators that help set the pace of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes an early step in glycolysis (see Figure 9.9), is one such enzyme. It is stimulated by AMP (derived from ADP) but is inhibited by ATP and by citrate. This feedback regulation adjusts the rate of respiration as the cell's catabolic and anabolic demands change. The cell also controls its catabolism. If the cell is working hard and its ATP concentration begins to drop, respiration speeds up. When there is plenty of ATP to meet demand, respiration slows down, 
sparing valuable organic molecules for other functions. Again, control is based mainly on regulating the activity of enzymes at strategic points in the catabolic pathway.</justification>

    <text>Why does a drop of dye disperse in water instead of staying clumped together?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>We can think of free energy as a measure of a system's instability: its tendency to change to a more stable state. Unstable systems (higher G) tend to change in such a way that they become more stable (lower G). For example, a diver on top of a platform is less stable (more likely to fall) than when floating in the water; a drop of concentrated dye is less stable (more likely to disperse) than when the dye is spread randomly through the liquid; and a glucose molecule is less stable (more likely to break down) than the simpler molecules into which it can be split (Figure 8.5). Unless something prevents it, each of these systems will move toward greater stability: The diver falls, the solution becomes uniformly colored, and the glucose molecule is broken down. Another term that describes a state of maximum stability is equilibrium, which you learned about in Chapter 2 in connection with chemical reactions. There is an important relationship between free energy and equilibrium, including 
chemical equilibrium. Recall that most chemical reactions are reversible and proceed to a point at which the forward and backward reactions occur at the same rate. The reaction is then said to be at chemical equilibrium, and there is no further net change in the relative concentration of products and reactants. As a reaction proceeds toward equilibrium, the free energy of the mixture of reactants and products decreases.</justification>

Some mutations change existing viruses into new genetic varieties (strains) that can cause disease, even in individuals who are immune to the ancestral virus.

For this reason, it is unlikely that a single-drug treatment would ever be effective against HIV; mutant forms of the virus that are resistant to a particular drug would no doubt proliferate in relatively short order.

        <justification>The concentration gradients of K+ and Na+ across the plasma membrane represent a chemical form of potential energy. The ion channels that convert this chemical potential energy to electrical potential energy can do so because they have selective permeability, allowing only certain ions to pass. For example, a potassium channel allows K+ to diffuse freely across the membrane, but not other ions, such as Na+. Diffusion of K+ through open potassium channels is critical for formation of the resting potential. The K+ concentration is 140 mM inside the cell, but only 5 mM outside. The chemical concentration gradient thus favors a net outflow of K+. Furthermore, a resting neuron has many open potassium channels, but very few open sodium channels (see Figure 48.7). Because Na+ and other ions can't readily cross the membrane, K+ outflow leads to a net negative charge inside the cell. This buildup of negative charge within the neuron is the major source of the membrane potential.</justification>

        <justification>Although the equilibrium potential for K+ is -'90 mV, the resting potential of a mammalian neuron is somewhat less negative. This difference reflects the small but steady movement of Na+ across the few open sodium channels in a resting neuron. The concentration gradient of Na+ has a direction opposite to that of K+ (see Table 48.1). Na+ therefore diffuses into the cell, making the inside of the cell less negative. If we model a membrane in which the only open channels are selectively permeable to Na+, we find that a tenfold higher concentration of Na+ in the outer chamber results in an equilibrium potential (ENa) of +62 mV (Figure 48.8b). In an actual neuron, the resting potential (-'60 to -'80 mV) is much closer to EK than to ENa because there are many open potassium channels but only a small number of open sodium channels.</justification>

Recessive alleles that are less favorable than their dominant counterparts, or even harmful in the current environment, can persist by propagation in heterozygous individuals. This latent variation is exposed to natural selection only when both parents carry the same recessive allele and two copies end up in the same zygote. This happens only rarely if the frequency of the recessive allele is very low.

A lethal recessive allele can be passed from one generation to the next by heterozygous carriers because the carriers themselves have normal phenotypes.</justification>

    <text>Why would a lymphocyte clone itself when activated?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>To begin with, an antigen is presented to a steady stream of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes (see Figure 43.7) until a match is made. A successful match then triggers changes in cell number and activity for the lymphocyte to which an antigen has bound. The binding of an antigen receptor to an epitope initiates events that activate the lymphocyte. Once activated, a B cell or T cell undergoes multiple cell divisions. For each activated cell, the result of this proliferation is a clone, a population of cells that are identical to the original cell. Some cells from this clone become effector cells, short-lived cells that take effect immediately against the antigen and any pathogens producing that antigen. The effector forms of B cells are plasma cells, which secrete antibodies. The effector forms of T cells are helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, whose roles we'll explore in Concept 43.3. The remaining cells in the clone become memory cells, long-lived cells that can give rise to effector 
cells if the same antigen is encountered later in the animal's life. Figure 43.14 Clonal selection. This figure illustrates clonal selection, using B cells as an example. In response to a specific antigen and to immune cell signals (not shown), one B cell divides and forms a clone of cells. The remaining B cells, which have antigen receptors specific for other antigens, do not respond. The clone of cells formed by the selected B cell gives rise to memory B cells and antibody-secreting plasma cells. T cells also undergo clonal selection, generating memory T cells and effector T cells (cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells). Figure 43.14 summarizes the proliferation of a lymphocyte into a clone of cells in response to binding to an antigen, using B cells as an example. This process is called clonal selection because an encounter with an antigen selects which lymphocyte will divide to produce a clonal population of thousands of cells specific for a particular epitope.</justification>

        <justification>43.2 In adaptive immunity, receptors provide pathogen-specific recognition (pp. 935-940) Adaptive immunity relies on lymphocytes that arise from stem cells in the bone marrow and complete their maturation in the bone marrow (B cells) or in the thymus (T cells). Lymphocytes have cell-surface antigen receptors for foreign molecules. All receptor proteins on a single B or T cell are the same, but there are millions of B and T cells in the body that differ in the foreign molecules that their receptors recognize. Upon infection, B and T cells specific for the pathogen are activated. Some T cells help other lymphocytes; others kill infected host cells. B cells called plasma cells produce soluble receptor proteins called antibodies, which bind to foreign molecules and cells. The activated lymphocytes called memory cells defend against future infections by the same pathogen. Recognition of foreign molecules involves the binding of variable regions of receptors to an epitope, a small region of 
an antigen. B cells and antibodies recognize epitopes on the surface of antigens circulating in the blood or lymph. T cells recognize protein epitopes in small antigen fragments (peptides) that are presented on the surface of host cells, complexed with cell-surface proteins called MHC (major histocompatibility complex) molecules. The four major characteristics of B and T cell development are the generation of cell diversity, self-tolerance, proliferation, and immunological memory.</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>The bonds between the phosphate groups of ATP can be broken by hydrolysis. When the terminal phosphate bond is broken by addition of a water molecule, a molecule of inorganic phosphate (HOPO32-, abbreviated &amp;#9413;i throughout this book) leaves the ATP, which becomes adenosine diphosphate, or ADP (Figure 8.8b). The reaction is exergonic and releases 7.3 kcal of energy per mole of ATP hydrolyzed: ATP + H2O &amp;rarr; ADP + &amp;#9413;i &amp;Delta;G = -'7.3 kcal/mol (-'30.5 kJ/mol) This is the free-energy change measured under standard conditions. In the cell, conditions do not conform to standard conditions, primarily because reactant and product concentrations differ from 1 M. For example, when ATP hydrolysis occurs under cellular conditions, the actual deltaG is about -'13 kcal/mol, 78% greater than the energy released by ATP hydrolysis under standard conditions.</justification>

      </answer>
      <answer>
        <justification>Four valves in the heart prevent backflow and keep blood moving in the correct direction (see Figures 42.7 and 42.8). Made of flaps of connective tissue, the valves open when pushed from one side and close when pushed from the other. An atrioventricular (AV) valve lies between each atrium and ventricle. The AV valves are anchored by strong fibers that prevent them from turning inside out. Pressure generated by the powerful contraction of the ventricles closes the AV valves, keeping blood from flowing back into the atria. Semilunar valves are located at the two exits of the heart: where the aorta leaves the left ventricle and where the pulmonary artery leaves the right ventricle. These valves are pushed open by the pressure generated during contraction of the ventricles. When the ventricles relax, blood pressure built up in the aorta closes the semilunar valves and prevents significant backflow. You can follow the closing of the two sets of heart valves either with a stethoscope or by 
pressing your ear tightly against the chest of a friend (or a friendly dog). The sound pattern is "lub-dup, lub-dup, lub-dup. " The first heart sound ("lub") is created by the recoil of blood against the closed AV valves. The second sound ("dup") is produced by the recoil of blood against the closed semilunar valves. If blood squirts backward through a defective valve, it may produce an abnormal sound called a heart murmur. Some people are born with heart murmurs; in others, the valves may be damaged by infection (from rheumatic fever, for instance). When a valve defect is severe enough to endanger health, surgeons may implant a mechanical replacement valve. However, not all heart murmurs are caused by a defect, and most valve defects do not reduce the efficiency of blood flow enough to warrant surgery.</justification>

        <justification>In all animals but the simplest invertebrates, the endocrine and nervous systems act coordinately to control reproduction and development. As an example, we'll explore the life cycle of the butterfly, a process highlighted earlier in the chapter. Figure 45.10 Regulation of insect development and metamorphosis. As shown here for a moth, most insects go through a series of larval stages, with each molt (shedding of the old exoskeleton) leading to a larger larva. Molting of the final larval stage gives rise to a pupa, in which metamorphosis produces the adult form of the insect. Neurohormones and hormones control the progression of stages. A butterfly larva grows in stages. Because its exoskeleton cannot stretch, the larva must periodically molt, shedding the old exoskeleton and secreting a new one. The signals that direct molting originate in the brain (Figure 45.10). There, neurosecretory cells produce prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), a polypeptide neurohormone. In response to PTTH, a 
pair of endocrine glands behind the brain release ecdysteroid. Ecdysteroid triggers each successive molt, as well as the metamorphosis of larva into butterfly during the final molt. Given that ecdysteroid triggers both molting and metamorphosis, what determines when metamorphosis takes place? The answer is a third molecule, juvenile hormone, secreted by another pair of endocrine glands behind the brain. As its name suggests, one of the many functions of juvenile hormone is to maintain larval (juvenile) characteristics. Juvenile hormone modulates the activity of ecdysteroid. As long as the level of juvenile hormone is high, ecdysteroid stimulates larval molting. When the juvenile hormone level drops, ecdysteroid-induced molting instead produces the pupal form, within which metamorphosis occurs.</justification>

    <text>Why is nad+ well suited as an electron carrier?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Cellular respiration does not oxidize glucose in a single explosive step either. Rather, glucose and other organic fuels are broken down in a series of steps, each one catalyzed by an enzyme. At key steps, electrons are stripped from the glucose. As is often the case in oxidation reactions, each electron travels with a proton: thus, as a hydrogen atom. The hydrogen atoms are not transferred directly to oxygen, but instead are usually passed first to an electron carrier, a coenzyme called NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, a derivative of the vitamin niacin). NAD+ is well suited as an electron carrier because it can cycle easily between oxidized (NAD+) and reduced (NADH) states. As an electron acceptor, NAD+ functions as an oxidizing agent during respiration. Figure 9.4 NAD+ as an electron shuttle. The full name for NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, describes its structure: The molecule consists of two nucleotides joined together at their phosphate groups (shown in yellow). 
(Nicotinamide is a nitrogenous base, although not one that is present in DNA or RNA; see Figure 5.26. ) The enzymatic transfer of 2 electrons and 1 proton (H+) from an organic molecule in food to NAD+ reduces the NAD+ to NADH; the second proton (H+) is released. Most of the electrons removed from food are transferred initially to NAD+. How does NAD+ trap electrons from glucose and other organic molecules? Enzymes called dehydrogenases remove a pair of hydrogen atoms (2 electrons and 2 protons) from the substrate (glucose, in this example), thereby oxidizing it. The enzyme delivers the 2 electrons along with 1 proton to its coenzyme, NAD+ (Figure 9.4). The other proton is released as a hydrogen ion (H+) into the surrounding solution: By receiving 2 negatively charged electrons but only 1 positively charged proton, NAD+ has its charge neutralized when it is reduced to NADH. The name NADH shows the hydrogen that has been received in the reaction. NAD+ is the most versatile electron acceptor in cellular 
respiration and functions in several of the redox steps during the breakdown of glucose.</justification>

        <justification>During lactic acid fermentation (Figure 9.17b), pyruvate is reduced directly by NADH to form lactate as an end product, with no release of CO2. (Lactate is the ionized form of lactic acid. ) Lactic acid fermentation by certain fungi and bacteria is used in the dairy industry to make cheese and yogurt. Human muscle cells make ATP by lactic acid fermentation when oxygen is scarce. This occurs during the early stages of strenuous exercise, when sugar catabolism for ATP production outpaces the muscle's supply of oxygen from the blood. Under these conditions, the cells switch from aerobic respiration to fermentation. The lactate that accumulates was previously thought to cause muscle fatigue and pain, but recent research suggests instead that increased levels of potassium ions (K+) may be to blame, while lactate appears to enhance muscle performance. In any case, the excess lactate is gradually carried away by the blood to the liver, where it is converted back to pyruvate by liver cells. 
Because oxygen is available, this pyruvate can then enter the mitochondria in liver cells and complete cellular respiration.</justification>

        <justification>Fermentation, anaerobic respiration, and aerobic respiration are three alternative cellular pathways for producing ATP by harvesting the chemical energy of food. All three use glycolysis to oxidize glucose and other organic fuels to pyruvate, with a net production of 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. And in all three pathways, NAD+ is the oxidizing agent that accepts electrons from food during glycolysis. A key difference among the three pathways is the contrasting mechanisms for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which is required to sustain glycolysis. In fermentation, the final electron acceptor is an organic molecule such as pyruvate (lactic acid fermentation) or acetaldehyde (alcohol fermentation). In cellular respiration, by contrast, electrons carried by NADH are transferred to an electron transport chain, where they move stepwise down a series of redox reactions to a final electron acceptor.

On the cellular level, our muscle cells behave as facultative anaerobes. In such cells, pyruvate is a fork in the metabolic road that leads to two alternative catabolic routes (Figure 9.18). Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate can be converted to acetyl CoA, and oxidation continues in the citric acid cycle via aerobic respiration. Under anaerobic conditions, lactic acid fermentation occurs: Pyruvate is diverted from the citric acid cycle, serving instead as an electron acceptor to recycle NAD+. To make the same amount of ATP, a facultative anaerobe has to consume sugar at a much faster rate when fermenting than when respiring.</justification>

        <justification>9.5 Fermentation and anaerobic respiration enable cells to produce ATP without the use of oxygen (pp. 177-179) Glycolysis nets 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation, whether oxygen is present or not. Under anaerobic conditions, either anaerobic respiration or fermentation can take place. In anaerobic respiration, an electron transport chain is present with a final electron acceptor other than oxygen. In fermentation, the electrons from NADH are passed to pyruvate or a derivative of pyruvate, regenerating the NAD+ required to oxidize more glucose. Two common types of fermentation are alcohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation. Fermentation and anaerobic or aerobic respiration all use glycolysis to oxidize glucose, but they differ in their final electron acceptor and whether an electron transport chain is used (respiration) or not (fermentation). Respiration yields more ATP; aerobic respiration, with O2 as the final electron acceptor, yields about 16 times as much ATP as does

    <text>Why does a signal transduction pathway have multiple steps?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>When receptors for signaling molecules are plasma membrane proteins, like most of those we have discussed, the transduction stage of cell signaling is usually a multistep pathway. Steps often include activation of proteins by addition or removal of phosphate groups or release of other small molecules or ions that act as messengers. One benefit of multiple steps is the possibility of greatly amplifying a signal. If some of the molecules in a pathway transmit the signal to numerous molecules at the next step in the series, the result can be a large number of activated molecules at the end of the pathway. Moreover, multistep pathways provide more opportunities for coordination and regulation than simpler systems do. This allows fine-tuning of the response, in both unicellular and multicellular organisms, as we'll discuss later in the chapter.</justification>

        <justification>The binding of a specific signaling molecule to a receptor in the plasma membrane triggers the first step in the chain of molecular interactions: the signal transduction pathway: that leads to a particular response within the cell. Like falling dominoes, the signal-activated receptor activates another molecule, which activates yet another molecule, and so on, until the protein that produces the final cellular response is activated. The molecules that relay a signal from receptor to response, which we call relay molecules in this book, are often proteins. The interaction of proteins is a major theme of cell signaling. Indeed, protein interaction is a unifying theme of all regulation at the cellular level. Keep in mind that the original signaling molecule is not physically passed along a signaling pathway; in most cases, it never even enters the cell. When we say that the signal is relayed along a pathway, we mean that certain information is passed on. At each step, the signal is 
transduced into a different form, commonly a shape change in a protein. Very often, the shape change is brought about by phosphorylation.</justification>

        <justification>Previous chapters introduced the concept of activating a protein by adding one or more phosphate groups to it (see Figure 8.10a). In Figure 11.7, we have already seen how phosphorylation is involved in the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases. In fact, the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins is a widespread cellular mechanism for regulating protein activity. An enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from ATP to a protein is generally known as a protein kinase. Recall that a receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates tyrosines on the other receptor tyrosine kinase in a dimer. Most cytoplasmic protein kinases, however, act on proteins different from themselves. Another distinction is that most cytoplasmic protein kinases phosphorylate either of two other amino acids, serine or threonine, rather than tyrosine. Such serine/threonine kinases are widely involved in signaling pathways in animals, plants, and fungi. Figure 11.10 A phosphorylation cascade. In a phosphorylation 
cascade, a series of different molecules in a pathway are phosphorylated in turn, each molecule adding a phosphate group to the next one in line. In this example, phosphorylation activates each molecule, and dephosphorylation returns it to its inactive form. The active and inactive forms of each protein are represented by different shapes to remind you that activation is usually associated with a change in molecular shape. Many of the relay molecules in signal transduction pathways are protein kinases, and they often act on other protein kinases in the pathway. Figure 11.10 depicts a hypothetical pathway containing three different protein kinases that create a "phosphorylation cascade. " The sequence shown is similar to many known pathways, including those triggered in yeast by mating factors and in animal cells by many growth factors. The signal is transmitted by a cascade of protein phosphorylations, each bringing with it a shape change. Each such shape change results from the interaction of the newly 
added phosphate groups with charged or polar amino acids (see Figure 5.16). The addition of phosphate groups often changes a protein from an inactive form to an active form. In other cases, though, phosphorylation decreases the activity of the protein.</justification>

        <justification>Equally important in the phosphorylation cascade are the protein phosphatases, enzymes that can rapidly remove phosphate groups from proteins, a process called dephosphorylation. By dephosphorylating and thus inactivating protein kinases, phosphatases provide the mechanism for turning off the signal transduction pathway when the initial signal is no longer present. Phosphatases also make the protein kinases available for reuse, enabling the cell to respond again to an extracellular signal. The phosphorylation-dephosphorylation system acts as a molecular switch in the cell, turning activities on or off, or up or down, as required. At any given moment, the activity of a protein regulated by phosphorylation depends on the balance in the cell between active kinase molecules and active phosphatase molecules.</justification>

        <justification>Not all components of signal transduction pathways are proteins. Many signaling pathways also involve small, nonprotein, water-soluble molecules or ions called second messengers. (This term is used because the pathway's "first messenger" is considered to be the extracellular signaling molecule: the ligand: that binds to the membrane receptor. ) Because second messengers are small and water-soluble, they can readily spread throughout the cell by diffusion. For example, as we'll see shortly, a second messenger called cyclic AMP carries the signal initiated by epinephrine from the plasma membrane of a liver or muscle cell into the cell's interior, where the signal eventually brings about glycogen breakdown. Second messengers participate in pathways that are initiated by both G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. The two most widely used second messengers are cyclic AMP and calcium ions, Ca2+. A large variety of relay proteins are sensitive to the cytosolic 
concentration of one or the other of these second messengers.</justification>

        <justification>As discussed on page 209, Earl Sutherland established that epinephrine somehow causes glycogen breakdown without passing through the plasma membrane. This discovery prompted him to search for a second messenger that transmits the signal from the plasma membrane to the metabolic machinery in the cytoplasm. Figure 11.11 Cyclic AMP. The second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) is made from ATP by adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme embedded in the plasma membrane. Cyclic AMP is inactivated by phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that converts it to AMP. Sutherland found that the binding of epinephrine to the plasma membrane of a liver cell elevates the cytosolic concentration of a compound called cyclic adenosine monophosphate, abbreviated as either cyclic AMP or cAMP (Figure 11.11). An enzyme embedded in the plasma membrane, adenylyl cyclase, converts ATP to cAMP in response to an extracellular signal: in this case, provided by epinephrine. But epinephrine doesn't stimulate adenylyl cyclase directly. When 
epinephrine outside the cell binds to a specific receptor protein, the protein activates adenylyl cyclase, which in turn can catalyze the synthesis of many molecules of cAMP. In this way, the normal cellular concentration of cAMP can be boosted 20-fold in a matter of seconds. The cAMP broadcasts the signal to the cytoplasm. It does not persist for long in the absence of the hormone because another enzyme, called phosphodiesterase, converts cAMP to AMP. Another surge of epinephrine is needed to boost the cytosolic concentration of cAMP again. Figure 11.12 cAMP as a second messenger in a G protein signaling pathway. The first messenger activates a G protein-coupled receptor, which activates a specific G protein. In turn, the G protein activates adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP. The cAMP then acts as a second messenger and activates another protein, usually protein kinase A, leading to cellular responses. Subsequent research has revealed that epinephrine is only one of many 
hormones and other signaling molecules that trigger the formation of cAMP. It has also brought to light the other components of cAMP pathways, including G proteins, G protein-coupled receptors, and protein kinases (Figure 11.12). The immediate effect of cAMP is usually the activation of a serine/threonine kinase called protein kinase A. The activated protein kinase A then phosphorylates various other proteins, depending on the cell type. (The complete pathway for epinephrine's stimulation of glycogen breakdown is shown later, in Figure 11.16. ) Further regulation of cell metabolism is provided by other G protein systems that inhibit adenylyl cyclase. In these systems, a different signaling molecule activates a different receptor, which in turn activates an inhibitory G protein.</justification>

Many signal transduction pathways include phosphorylation cascades, in which a series of protein kinases each add a phosphate group to the next one in line, activating it. Enzymes called protein phosphatases remove the phosphate groups. The balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulates the activity of proteins involved in the sequential steps of a signal transduction pathway. Second messengers, such as the small molecule cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the ion Ca2+, diffuse readily through the cytosol and 
thus help broadcast signals quickly. Many G proteins activate adenylyl cyclase, which makes cAMP from ATP. Cells use Ca2+ as a second messenger in both G protein and tyrosine kinase pathways. The tyrosine kinase pathways can also involve two other second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 can trigger a subsequent increase in Ca2+ levels.</justification>

        <justification>The series of changes in cellular proteins that converts the extracellular chemical signal to a specific intracellular response is called signal transduction. As described in Chapter 11, a signal transduction pathway typically involves multiple steps, each involving specific molecular interactions. Figure 45.7 Cell-surface hormone receptors trigger signal transduction. To explore the role of signal transduction in hormone signaling, consider one response to short-term stress. When you find yourself in a stressful situation, perhaps running to catch a bus, your adrenal glands secrete epinephrine, a hormone also called adrenaline. When epinephrine reaches the liver, it binds to a G protein-coupled receptor in the plasma membrane of target cells, as discussed in Chapter 11 and reviewed in Figure 45.7. The binding of hormone to receptor triggers a cascade of events involving synthesis of cyclic AMP (cAMP) as a short-lived second messenger. Activation of protein kinase A by cAMP leads to 
activation of an enzyme required for glycogen breakdown and inactivation of an enzyme necessary for glycogen synthesis. The net result is that the liver releases glucose into the bloodstream, providing the fuel you need to chase the departing bus.</justification>

        <justification>So far, we have focused on synapses where a neurotransmitter binds directly to an ion channel, causing the channel to open. However, there are also synapses in which the receptor for the neurotransmitter is not part of an ion channel. At these synapses, the neurotransmitter binds to a metabotropic receptor, so called because the resulting opening or closing of ion channels depends on one or more metabolic steps. Binding of a neurotransmitter to a metabotropic receptor activates a signal transduction pathway in the postsynaptic cell involving a second messenger (see Chapter 11). Compared with the postsynaptic potentials produced by ligand-gated channels, the effects of these second-messenger systems have a slower onset but last longer (minutes or even hours). Second messengers modulate the responsiveness of postsynaptic neurons to inputs in diverse ways, such as by altering the number of open potassium channels. A variety of signal transduction pathways play a role in modulating 
synaptic transmission. One of the best-studied pathways involves cyclic AMP (cAMP) as a second messenger. For example, when the neurotransmitter norepinephrine binds to its metabotropic receptor, the neurotransmitter-receptor complex activates a G protein, which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme that converts ATP to cAMP (see Figure 11.11). Cyclic AMP activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates specific ion channel proteins in the postsynaptic membrane, causing them to open or close. Because of the amplifying effect of the signal transduction pathway, the binding of a neurotransmitter molecule to a metabotropic receptor can open or close many channels.</justification>

        <justification>Recall from Chapter 5 that the three-dimensional structures of proteins are sensitive to their environment. As a consequence, each enzyme works better under some conditions than under other conditions, because these optimal conditions favor the most active shape for the enzyme molecule. Figure 8.16 Environmental factors affecting enzyme activity. Each enzyme has an optimal (a) temperature and (b) pH that favor the most active shape of the protein molecule. Temperature and pH are environmental factors important in the activity of an enzyme. Up to a point, the rate of an enzymatic reaction increases with increasing temperature, partly because substrates collide with active sites more frequently when the molecules move rapidly. Above that temperature, however, the speed of the enzymatic reaction drops sharply. The thermal agitation of the enzyme molecule disrupts the hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and other weak interactions that stabilize the active shape of the enzyme, and the protein 
molecule eventually denatures. Each enzyme has an optimal temperature at which its reaction rate is greatest. Without denaturing the enzyme, this temperature allows the greatest number of molecular collisions and the fastest conversion of the reactants to product molecules. Most human enzymes have optimal temperatures of about 35-40 degree C (close to human body temperature). The thermophilic bacteria that live in hot springs contain enzymes with optimal temperatures of 70 degree C or higher (Figure 8.16a on the next page).</justification>

        <justification>Figure 8.7 Equilibrium and work in isolated and open systems. Reactions in an isolated system eventually reach equilibrium and can then do no work, as illustrated by the isolated hydroelectric system in Figure 8.7a. The chemical reactions of metabolism are reversible, and they, too, would reach equilibrium if they occurred in the isolation of a test tube. Because systems at equilibrium are at a minimum of G and can do no work, a cell that has reached metabolic equilibrium is dead! The fact that metabolism as a whole is never at equilibrium is one of the defining features of life. Like most systems, a living cell is not in equilibrium. The constant flow of materials in and out of the cell keeps the metabolic pathways from ever reaching equilibrium, and the cell continues to do work throughout its life. This principle is illustrated by the open (and more realistic) hydroelectric system in Figure 8.7b. However, unlike this simple single-step system, a catabolic pathway in a cell releases 
free energy in a series of reactions. An example is cellular respiration, illustrated by analogy in Figure 8.7c. Some of the reversible reactions of respiration are constantly "pulled" in one direction: that is, they are kept out of equilibrium. The key to maintaining this lack of equilibrium is that the product of a reaction does not accumulate but instead becomes a reactant in the next step; finally, waste products are expelled from the cell. The overall sequence of reactions is kept going by the huge free-energy difference between glucose and oxygen at the top of the energy "hill" and carbon dioxide and water at the "downhill" end. As long as our cells have a steady supply of glucose or other fuels and oxygen and are able to expel waste products to the surroundings, their metabolic pathways never reach equilibrium and can continue to do the work of life. We see once again how important it is to think of organisms as open systems. Sunlight provides a daily source of free energy for an ecosystem's plants 
and other photosynthetic organisms. Animals and other nonphotosynthetic organisms in an ecosystem must have a source of free energy in the form of the organic products of photosynthesis. Now that we have applied the free-energy concept to metabolism, we are ready to see how a cell actually performs the work of life.</justification>

Temperature and pH are environmental factors important in the activity of an enzyme. Up to a point, the rate of an enzymatic reaction increases with increasing temperature, partly because substrates collide with active sites more frequently when the molecules move rapidly. Above that temperature, however, the speed of the enzymatic reaction drops sharply. The thermal agitation of the enzyme molecule disrupts the hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and other weak interactions that stabilize the active shape of the enzyme, and the protein molecule eventually denatures.</justification>

    <text>Why isn't the exact number of protons that are needed to make 1 atp molecule known?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Why are the numbers in Figure 9.16 inexact? There are three reasons we cannot state an exact number of ATP molecules generated by the breakdown of one molecule of glucose. First, phosphorylation and the redox reactions are not directly coupled to each other, so the ratio of the number of NADH molecules to the number of ATP molecules is not a whole number. We know that 1 NADH results in 10 H+ being transported out across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but the exact number of H+ that must reenter the mitochondrial matrix via ATP synthase to generate 1 ATP has long been debated. Based on experimental data, however, most biochemists now agree that the most accurate number is 4 H+. Therefore, a single molecule of NADH generates enough proton-motive force for the synthesis of 2.5 ATP. The citric acid cycle also supplies electrons to the electron transport chain via FADH2, but since its electrons enter later in the chain, each molecule of this electron carrier is responsible for transport 
of only enough H+ for the synthesis of 1.5 ATP. These numbers also take into account the slight energetic cost of moving the ATP formed in the mitochondrion out into the cytosol, where it will be used. Second, the ATP yield varies slightly depending on the type of shuttle used to transport electrons from the cytosol into the mitochondrion. The mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to NADH, so NADH in the cytosol is segregated from the machinery of oxidative phosphorylation. The 2 electrons of NADH captured in glycolysis must be conveyed into the mitochondrion by one of several electron shuttle systems. Depending on the kind of shuttle in a particular cell type, the electrons are passed either to NAD+ or to FAD in the mitochondrial matrix (see Figure 9.16). If the electrons are passed to FAD, as in brain cells, only about 1.5 ATP can result from each NADH that was originally generated in the cytosol. If the electrons are passed to mitochondrial NAD+, as in liver cells and heart cells, the yield is about 
2.5 ATP per NADH. A third variable that reduces the yield of ATP is the use of the proton-motive force generated by the redox reactions of respiration to drive other kinds of work. For example, the proton-motive force powers the mitochondrion's uptake of pyruvate from the cytosol. However, if all the proton-motive force generated by the electron transport chain were used to drive ATP synthesis, one glucose molecule could generate a maximum of 28 ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation plus 4 ATP (net) from substrate-level phosphorylation to give a total yield of about 32 ATP (or only about 30 ATP if the less efficient shuttle were functioning).</justification>

ATP consists of an organic molecule called adenosine attached to a string of three phosphate groups: Where three phosphates are present in series, as in ATP, one phosphate may be split off as a result of a reaction with water. This inorganic phosphate ion, HOPO32-', is often abbreviated Pi in this book. Having lost one phosphate, ATP becomes adenosine diphosphate, or ADP.

        <justification>Figure 8.8 The structure and hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP (adenosine triphosphate) was introduced in Chapter 4 when we discussed the phosphate group as a functional group. ATP contains the sugar ribose, with the nitrogenous base adenine and a chain of three phosphate groups bonded to it (Figure 8.8a). In addition to its role in energy coupling, ATP is also one of the nucleoside triphosphates used to make RNA (see Figure 5.26). The bonds between the phosphate groups of ATP can be broken by hydrolysis. When the terminal phosphate bond is broken by addition of a water molecule, a molecule of inorganic phosphate (HOPO32-, abbreviated &amp;#9413;i throughout this book) leaves the ATP, which becomes adenosine diphosphate, or ADP (Figure 8.8b). The reaction is exergonic and releases 7.3 kcal of energy per mole of ATP hydrolyzed: ATP + H2O &amp;rarr; ADP + &amp;#9413;i &amp;Delta;G = -'7.3 kcal/mol (-'30.5 kJ/mol) This is the free-energy change measured under standard 
conditions. In the cell, conditions do not conform to standard conditions, primarily because reactant and product concentrations differ from 1 M. For example, when ATP hydrolysis occurs under cellular conditions, the actual deltaG is about -'13 kcal/mol, 78% greater than the energy released by ATP hydrolysis under standard conditions. Because their hydrolysis releases energy, the phosphate bonds of ATP are sometimes referred to as high-energy phosphate bonds, but the term is misleading. The phosphate bonds of ATP are not unusually strong bonds, as "high-energy" may imply; rather, the reactants (ATP and water) themselves have high energy relative to the energy of the products (ADP and &amp;#9413;i). The release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change to a state of lower free energy, not from the phosphate bonds themselves. ATP is useful to the cell because the energy it releases on losing a phosphate group is somewhat greater than the energy most other molecules could deliver. 
But why does this hydrolysis release so much energy? If we reexamine the ATP molecule in Figure 8.8a, we can see that all three phosphate groups are negatively charged. These like charges are crowded together, and their mutual repulsion contributes to the instability of this region of the ATP molecule. The triphosphate tail of ATP is the chemical equivalent of a compressed spring.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>When ATP is hydrolyzed in a test tube, the release of free energy merely heats the surrounding water. In an organism, this same generation of heat can sometimes be beneficial. For instance, the process of shivering uses ATP hydrolysis during muscle contraction to generate heat and warm the body. In most cases in the cell, however, the generation of heat alone would be an inefficient (and potentially dangerous) use of a valuable energy resource. Instead, the cell's proteins harness the energy released during ATP hydrolysis in several ways to perform the three types of cellular work: chemical, transport, and mechanical. Figure 8.9 How ATP drives chemical work: Energy coupling using ATP hydrolysis. In this example, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis is used to drive an endergonic process: the cellular synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid and ammonia. For example, with the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to use the energy released by ATP hydrolysis 
directly to drive chemical reactions that, by themselves, are endergonic. If the deltaG of an endergonic reaction is less than the amount of energy released by ATP hydrolysis, then the two reactions can be coupled so that, overall, the coupled reactions are exergonic (Figure 8.9). This usually involves the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to some other molecule, such as the reactant. The recipient with the phosphate group covalently bonded to it is then called a phosphorylated intermediate. The key to coupling exergonic and endergonic reactions is the formation of this phosphorylated intermediate, which is more reactive (less stable) than the original unphosphorylated molecule. Figure 8.10 How ATP drives transport and mechanical work. ATP hydrolysis causes changes in the shapes and binding affinities of proteins. This can occur either (a) directly, by phosphorylation, as shown for a membrane protein carrying out active transport of a solute (see also Figure 7.18), or (b) indirectly, via noncovalent 
binding of ATP and its hydrolytic products, as is the case for motor proteins that move vesicles (and other organelles) along cytoskeletal "tracks" in the cell (see also Figure 6.21). Transport and mechanical work in the cell are also nearly always powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. In these cases, ATP hydrolysis leads to a change in a protein's shape and often its ability to bind another molecule. Sometimes this occurs via a phosphorylated intermediate, as seen for the transport protein in Figure 8.10a. In most instances of mechanical work involving motor proteins "walking" along cytoskeletal elements (Figure 8.10b), a cycle occurs in which ATP is first bound noncovalently to the motor protein. Next, ATP is hydrolyzed, releasing ADP and &amp;#9413;i. Another ATP molecule can then bind. At each stage, the motor protein changes its shape and ability to bind the cytoskeleton, resulting in movement of the protein along the cytoskeletal track.</justification>

        <justification>An object not presently moving may still possess energy. Energy that is not kinetic is called potential energy; it is energy that matter possesses because of its location or structure. Water behind a dam, for instance, possesses energy because of its altitude above sea level. Molecules possess energy because of the arrangement of electrons in the bonds between their atoms. Chemical energy is a term used by biologists to refer to the potential energy available for release in a chemical reaction. Recall that catabolic pathways release energy by breaking down complex molecules. Biologists say that these complex molecules, such as glucose, are high in chemical energy. During a catabolic reaction, some bonds are broken and others formed, releasing energy and resulting in lower-energy breakdown products. This transformation also occurs, for example, in the engine of a car when the hydrocarbons of gasoline react explosively with oxygen, releasing the energy that pushes the pistons and 
producing exhaust. Although less explosive, a similar reaction of food molecules with oxygen provides chemical energy in biological systems, producing carbon dioxide and water as waste products. Biochemical pathways, carried out in the context of cellular structures, enable cells to release chemical energy from food molecules and use the energy to power life processes.</justification>

We can think of free energy as a measure of a system's instability: its tendency to change to a more stable state. Unstable systems (higher G) tend to change in such a way that they become more stable (lower G). For example, a diver on top of a platform is less stable (more likely to fall) than when floating in the water; a drop of concentrated dye is less stable (more likely to disperse) than when the dye is spread randomly through the liquid; and a glucose molecule is less stable (more likely to break down) than the simpler molecules into which it can be split (Figure 8.5).

The overall sequence of reactions is kept going by the huge free-energy difference between glucose and oxygen at the top of the energy "hill" and carbon dioxide and water at the "downhill" end.

        <justification>The oxidation of methane by oxygen is the main combustion reaction that occurs at the burner of a gas stove. The combustion of gasoline in an automobile engine is also a redox reaction; the energy released pushes the pistons. But the energy-yielding redox process of greatest interest to biologists is respiration: the oxidation of glucose and other molecules in food. Examine again the summary equation for cellular respiration, but this time think of it as a redox process: As in the combustion of methane or gasoline, the fuel (glucose) is oxidized and oxygen is reduced. The electrons lose potential energy along the way, and energy is released. In general, organic molecules that have an abundance of hydrogen are excellent fuels because their bonds are a source of "hilltop" electrons, whose energy may be released as these electrons "fall" down an energy gradient when they are transferred to oxygen. The summary equation for respiration indicates that hydrogen is transferred from glucose to 
oxygen. But the important point, not visible in the summary equation, is that the energy state of the electron changes as hydrogen (with its electron) is transferred to oxygen. In respiration, the oxidation of glucose transfers electrons to a lower energy state, liberating energy that becomes available for ATP synthesis.</justification>

Cellular respiration is a more complete breakdown of glucose; in aerobic respiration, oxygen is used as a reactant.

Oxidation is the loss of electrons from one substance, while reduction is the addition of electrons to the other. During aerobic respiration, glucose (C6H12O6) is oxidized to CO2, and O2 is reduced to H2O. Electrons lose potential energy during their transfer from glucose or other organic compounds to oxygen. Electrons are usually passed first to NAD+, reducing it to NADH, and then from NADH to an electron transport chain, which conducts them to O2 in energy-releasing steps.

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Fluctuating concentrations of regulators can cause a sophisticated pattern of response in the activity of cellular enzymes. The products of ATP hydrolysis (ADP and Pi), for example, play a complex role in balancing the flow of traffic between anabolic and catabolic pathways by their effects on key enzymes. ATP binds to several catabolic enzymes allosterically, lowering their affinity for substrate and thus inhibiting their activity. ADP, however, functions as an activator of the same enzymes. This is logical because catabolism functions in regenerating ATP. If ATP production lags behind its use, ADP accumulates and activates the enzymes that speed up catabolism, producing more ATP. If the supply of ATP exceeds demand, then catabolism slows down as ATP molecules accumulate and bind to the same enzymes, inhibiting them. (You'll see specific examples of this type of regulation when you learn about cellular respiration in the next chapter. ) ATP, ADP, and other related molecules also 
affect key enzymes in anabolic pathways. In this way, allosteric enzymes control the rates of important reactions in both sorts of metabolic pathways.</justification>

        <justification>Basic principles of supply and demand regulate the metabolic economy. The cell does not waste energy making more of a particular substance than it needs. If there is a glut of a certain amino acid, for example, the anabolic pathway that synthesizes that amino acid from an intermediate of the citric acid cycle is switched off. The most common mechanism for this control is feedback inhibition: The end product of the anabolic pathway inhibits the enzyme that catalyzes an early step of the pathway (see Figure 8.21). This prevents the needless diversion of key metabolic intermediates from uses that are more urgent. Figure 9.20 The control of cellular respiration. Allosteric enzymes at certain points in the respiratory pathway respond to inhibitors and activators that help set the pace of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes an early step in glycolysis (see Figure 9.9), is one such enzyme. It is stimulated by AMP (derived from ADP) but is inhibited by 
ATP and by citrate. This feedback regulation adjusts the rate of respiration as the cell's catabolic and anabolic demands change. The cell also controls its catabolism. If the cell is working hard and its ATP concentration begins to drop, respiration speeds up. When there is plenty of ATP to meet demand, respiration slows down, sparing valuable organic molecules for other functions. Again, control is based mainly on regulating the activity of enzymes at strategic points in the catabolic pathway. As shown in Figure 9.20, one important switch is phosphofructokinase, the enzyme that catalyzes step 3 of glycolysis (see Figure 9.9). That is the first step that commits the substrate irreversibly to the glycolytic pathway. By controlling the rate of this step, the cell can speed up or slow down the entire catabolic process. Phosphofructokinase can thus be considered the pacemaker of respiration. Phosphofructokinase is an allosteric enzyme with receptor sites for specific inhibitors and activators. It is inhibited 
by ATP and stimulated by AMP (adenosine monophosphate), which the cell derives from ADP. As ATP accumulates, inhibition of the enzyme slows down glycolysis. The enzyme becomes active again as cellular work converts ATP to ADP (and AMP) faster than ATP is being regenerated. Phosphofructokinase is also sensitive to citrate, the first product of the citric acid cycle. If citrate accumulates in mitochondria, some of it passes into the cytosol and inhibits phosphofructokinase. This mechanism helps synchronize the rates of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. As citrate accumulates, glycolysis slows down, and the supply of acetyl groups to the citric acid cycle decreases. If citrate consumption increases, either because of a demand for more ATP or because anabolic pathways are draining off intermediates of the citric acid cycle, glycolysis accelerates and meets the demand. Metabolic balance is augmented by the control of enzymes that catalyze other key steps of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.</justification>

        <justification>During oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport chains convert the chemical energy to a form used for ATP synthesis in the process called chemiosmosis. As diagrammed in Figure 9.6, glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation followed by the citric acid cycle are the catabolic pathways that break down glucose and other organic fuels. Glycolysis, which occurs in the cytosol, begins the degradation process by breaking glucose into two molecules of a compound called pyruvate. In eukaryotes, pyruvate enters the mitochondrion and is oxidized to a compound called acetyl CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle. There, the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide is completed. (In prokaryotes, these processes take place in the cytosol. ) Thus, the carbon dioxide produced by respiration represents fragments of oxidized organic molecules. Visit the Study Area at www. masteringbiology. com for the BioFlix 3-D Animation on Cellular Respiration. Some of the steps of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are 
redox reactions in which dehydrogenases transfer electrons from substrates to NAD+, forming NADH. In the third stage of respiration, the electron transport chain accepts electrons from the breakdown products of the first two stages (most often via NADH) and passes these electrons from one molecule to another. At the end of the chain, the electrons are combined with molecular oxygen and hydrogen ions (H+), forming water (see Figure 9.5b). The energy released at each step of the chain is stored in a form the mitochondrion (or prokaryotic cell) can use to make ATP from ADP. This mode of ATP synthesis is called oxidative phosphorylation because it is powered by the redox reactions of the electron transport chain.</justification>

        <justification>From studying the structure of ATP synthase, scientists have learned how the flow of H+ through this large enzyme powers ATP generation. ATP synthase is a multisubunit complex with four main parts, each made up of multiple polypeptides. Protons move one by one into binding sites on one of the parts (the rotor), causing it to spin in a way that catalyzes ATP production from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Figure 9.14). The flow of protons thus behaves somewhat like a rushing stream that turns a waterwheel. ATP synthase is the smallest molecular rotary motor known in nature. Figure 9.15 Chemiosmosis couples the electron transport chain to ATP synthesis. &amp;#x278A; NADH and FADH2 shuttle high-energy electrons extracted from food during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle into an electron transport chain built into the inner mitochondrial membrane. The gold arrows trace the transport of electrons, which finally pass to oxygen at the "downhill" end of the chain, forming water. As Figure 9.
13 showed, most of the electron carriers of the chain are grouped into four complexes. Two mobile carriers, ubiquinone (Q) and cytochrome c (Cyt c), move rapidly, ferrying electrons between the large complexes. As complexes I, III, and IV accept and then donate electrons, they pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space.

        <justification>How can food be oxidized without cellular respiration? Remember, oxidation simply refers to the loss of electrons to an electron acceptor, so it does not need to involve oxygen. Glycolysis oxidizes glucose to two molecules of pyruvate. The oxidizing agent of glycolysis is NAD+, and neither oxygen nor any electron transfer chain is involved. Overall, glycolysis is exergonic, and some of the energy made available is used to produce 2 ATP (net) by substrate-level phosphorylation. If oxygen is present, then additional ATP is made by oxidative phosphorylation when NADH passes electrons removed from glucose to the electron transport chain.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>A key difference among the three pathways is the contrasting mechanisms for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which is required to sustain glycolysis. In fermentation, the final electron acceptor is an organic molecule such as pyruvate (lactic acid fermentation) or acetaldehyde (alcohol fermentation). In cellular respiration, by contrast, electrons carried by NADH are transferred to an electron transport chain, where they move stepwise down a series of redox reactions to a final electron acceptor. In aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is oxygen; in anaerobic respiration, the final acceptor is another molecule that is electronegative (although invariably less so than oxygen). Passage of electrons from NADH to the electron transport chain not only regenerates the NAD+ required for glycolysis but pays an ATP bonus when the stepwise electron transport from this NADH to oxygen drives oxidative phosphorylation. An even bigger ATP payoff comes from the oxidation of pyruvate in the 
mitochondrion, which is unique to respiration. Without an electron transport chain, the energy still stored in pyruvate is unavailable to most cells. Thus, cellular respiration harvests much more energy from each sugar molecule than fermentation can.</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 8.7 Equilibrium and work in isolated and open systems. Reactions in an isolated system eventually reach equilibrium and can then do no work, as illustrated by the isolated hydroelectric system in Figure 8.7a. The chemical reactions of metabolism are reversible, and they, too, would reach equilibrium if they occurred in the isolation of a test tube. Because systems at equilibrium are at a minimum of G and can do no work, a cell that has reached metabolic equilibrium is dead! The fact that metabolism as a whole is never at equilibrium is one of the defining features of life. Like most systems, a living cell is not in equilibrium. The constant flow of materials in and out of the cell keeps the metabolic pathways from ever reaching equilibrium, and the cell continues to do work throughout its life. This principle is illustrated by the open (and more realistic) hydroelectric system in Figure 8.7b. However, unlike this simple single-step system, a catabolic pathway in a cell releases 
free energy in a series of reactions. An example is cellular respiration, illustrated by analogy in Figure 8.7c. Some of the reversible reactions of respiration are constantly "pulled" in one direction: that is, they are kept out of equilibrium. The key to maintaining this lack of equilibrium is that the product of a reaction does not accumulate but instead becomes a reactant in the next step; finally, waste products are expelled from the cell. The overall sequence of reactions is kept going by the huge free-energy difference between glucose and oxygen at the top of the energy "hill" and carbon dioxide and water at the "downhill" end. As long as our cells have a steady supply of glucose or other fuels and oxygen and are able to expel waste products to the surroundings, their metabolic pathways never reach equilibrium and can continue to do the work of life.</justification>

        <justification>Nonpolar molecules, such as hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and oxygen, are hydrophobic and can therefore dissolve in the lipid bilayer of the membrane and cross it easily, without the aid of membrane proteins. However, the hydrophobic interior of the membrane impedes the direct passage of ions and polar molecules, which are hydrophilic, through the membrane. Polar molecules such as glucose and other sugars pass only slowly through a lipid bilayer, and even water, an extremely small polar molecule, does not cross very rapidly. A charged atom or molecule and its surrounding shell of water (see Figure 3.7) find the hydrophobic interior of the membrane even more difficult to penetrate. Furthermore, the lipid bilayer is only one aspect of the gatekeeper system responsible for the selective permeability of a cell. Proteins built into the membrane play key roles in regulating transport.</justification>

        <justification>Cell membranes are permeable to specific ions and a variety of polar molecules. These hydrophilic substances can avoid contact with the lipid bilayer by passing through transport proteins that span the membrane. Some transport proteins, called channel proteins, function by having a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or atomic ions use as a tunnel through the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, left). For example, the passage of water molecules through the membrane in certain cells is greatly facilitated by channel proteins known as aquaporins. Each aquaporin allows entry of up to 3 billion (3 * 109) water molecules per second, passing single file through its central channel, which fits ten at a time. Without aquaporins, only a tiny fraction of these water molecules would pass through the same area of the cell membrane in a second, so the channel protein brings about a tremendous increase in rate.</justification>

        <justification>Let's look more closely at how water and certain hydrophilic solutes cross a membrane. As mentioned earlier, many polar molecules and ions impeded by the lipid bilayer of the membrane diffuse passively with the help of transport proteins that span the membrane. This phenomenon is called facilitated diffusion. Cell biologists are still trying to learn exactly how various transport proteins facilitate diffusion. Most transport proteins are very specific: They transport some substances but not others. Figure 7.17 Two types of transport proteins that carry out facilitated diffusion. In both cases, the protein can transport the solute in either direction, but the net movement is down the concentration gradient of the solute. As described earlier, the two types of transport proteins are channel proteins and carrier proteins. Channel proteins simply provide corridors that allow specific molecules or ions to cross the membrane (Figure 7.17a). The hydrophilic passageways provided by these 
proteins can allow water molecules or small ions to diffuse very quickly from one side of the membrane to the other. Aquaporins, the water channel proteins, facilitate the massive amounts of diffusion that occur in plant cells and in animal cells such as red blood cells (see Figure 7.15). Certain kidney cells also have a high number of aquaporins, allowing them to reclaim water from urine before it is excreted. If the kidneys did not perform this function, you would excrete about 180 L of urine per day: and have to drink an equal volume of water!</justification>

The transport of water molecules across membranes is facilitated by transport proteins called aquaporins (see Chapter 7).

        <justification>In many chemical reactions, there is a transfer of one or more electrons (e-') from one reactant to another. These electron transfers are called oxidation-reduction reactions, or redox reactions for short. In a redox reaction, the loss of electrons from one substance is called oxidation, and the addition of electrons to another substance is known as reduction. (Note that adding electrons is called reduction; negatively charged electrons added to an atom reduce the amount of positive charge of that atom. ) To take a simple, nonbiological example, consider the reaction between the elements sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) that forms table salt: We could generalize a redox reaction this way: In the generalized reaction, substance Xe-', the electron donor, is called the reducing agent; it reduces Y, which accepts the donated electron. Substance Y, the electron acceptor, is the oxidizing agent; it oxidizes Xe-' by removing its electron. Because an electron transfer requires both a donor and an 
acceptor, oxidation and reduction always go together.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Molecules have a type of energy called thermal energy (heat), due to their constant motion. One result of this motion is diffusion, the movement of molecules of any substance so that they spread out evenly into the available space. Each molecule moves randomly, yet diffusion of a population of molecules may be directional. To understand this process, let's imagine a synthetic membrane separating pure water from a solution of a dye in water. Study Figure 7.13a carefully to appreciate how diffusion would result in both solutions having equal concentrations of the dye molecules. Once that point is reached, there will be a dynamic equilibrium, with as many dye molecules crossing the membrane each second in one direction as in the other. We can now state a simple rule of diffusion: In the absence of other forces, a substance will diffuse from where it is more concentrated to where it is less concentrated. Put another way, any substance will diffuse down its concentration gradient, the 
region along which the density of a chemical substance increases or decreases (in this case, decreases). No work must be done to make this happen; diffusion is a spontaneous process, needing no input of energy. Note that each substance diffuses down its own concentration gradient, unaffected by the concentration gradients of other substances (Figure 7.13b). Much of the traffic across cell membranes occurs by diffusion. When a substance is more concentrated on one side of a membrane than on the other, there is a tendency for the substance to diffuse across the membrane down its concentration gradient (assuming that the membrane is permeable to that substance). One important example is the uptake of oxygen by a cell performing cellular respiration. Dissolved oxygen diffuses into the cell across the plasma membrane. As long as cellular respiration consumes the O2 as it enters, diffusion into the cell will continue because the concentration gradient favors movement in that direction. The diffusion of a substance 
across a biological membrane is called passive transport because the cell does not have to expend energy to make it happen. The concentration gradient itself represents potential energy (see Chapter 2, p. 35) and drives diffusion. Remember, however, that membranes are selectively permeable and therefore have different effects on the rates of diffusion of various molecules. In the case of water, aquaporins allow water to diffuse very rapidly across the membranes of certain cells.</justification>

        <justification>7.3 Passive transport is diffusion of a substance across a membrane with no energy investment (pp. 132-135) Diffusion is the spontaneous movement of a substance down its concentration gradient. Water diffuses out through the permeable membrane of a cell (osmosis) if the solution outside has a higher solute concentration (hypertonic) than the cytosol; water enters the cell if the solution has a lower solute concentration (hypotonic). If the concentrations are equal (isotonic), no net osmosis occurs. Cell survival depends on balancing water uptake and loss. Cells lacking walls (as in animals and some protists) are isotonic with their environments or have adaptations for osmoregulation. Plants, prokaryotes, fungi, and some protists have relatively inelastic cell walls, so the cells don't burst in a hypotonic environment. In a type of passive transport called facilitated diffusion, a transport protein speeds the movement of water or a solute across a membrane down its concentration 
gradient.</justification>

    <text>Why do electrons spend more time near electronegative atoms?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Atoms in a molecule attract shared electrons to varying degrees, depending on the element. The attraction of a particular atom for the electrons of a covalent bond is called its electronegativity. The more electronegative an atom is, the more strongly it pulls shared electrons toward itself. In a covalent bond between two atoms of the same element, the electrons are shared equally because the two atoms have the same electronegativity: the tug-of-war is at a standoff. Such a bond is called a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, the single bond of H2 is nonpolar, as is the double bond of O2. However, when one atom is bonded to a more electronegative atom, the electrons of the bond are not shared equally. This type of bond is called a polar covalent bond. Such bonds vary in their polarity, depending on the relative electronegativity of the two atoms. For example, the bonds between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms of a water molecule are quite polar (Figure 2.13). Oxygen is one of the most 
electronegative of all the elements, attracting shared electrons much more strongly than hydrogen does. In a covalent bond between oxygen and hydrogen, the electrons spend more time near the oxygen nucleus than they do near the hydrogen nucleus. Because electrons have a negative charge and are pulled toward oxygen in a water molecule, the oxygen atom has a partial negative charge (indicated by the Greek letter delta with a minus sign, delta-, or "delta minus"), and each hydrogen atom has a partial positive charge (, or "delta plus"). In contrast, the individual bonds of methane (CH4) are much less polar because the electronegativities of carbon and hydrogen are similar.</justification>

    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Every chemical reaction between molecules involves both bond breaking and bond forming. For example, the hydrolysis of sucrose involves breaking the bond between glucose and fructose and one of the bonds of a water molecule and then forming two new bonds, as shown above. Changing one molecule into another generally involves contorting the starting molecule into a highly unstable state before the reaction can proceed. This contortion can be compared to the bending of a metal key ring when you pry it open to add a new key. The key ring is highly unstable in its opened form but returns to a stable state once the key is threaded all the way onto the ring. To reach the contorted state where bonds can change, reactant molecules must absorb energy from their surroundings. When the new bonds of the product molecules form, energy is released as heat, and the molecules return to stable shapes with lower energy than the contorted state.</justification>

        <justification>In most plants, initial fixation of carbon occurs via rubisco, the Calvin cycle enzyme that adds CO2 to ribulose bisphosphate. Such plants are called C3 plants because the first organic product of carbon fixation is a three-carbon compound, 3-phosphoglycerate (see Figure 10.19). Rice, wheat, and soybeans are C3 plants that are important in agriculture. When their stomata partially close on hot, dry days, C3 plants produce less sugar because the declining level of CO2 in the leaf starves the Calvin cycle. In addition, rubisco can bind O2 in place of CO2. As CO2 becomes scarce within the air spaces of the leaf, rubisco adds O2 to the Calvin cycle instead of CO2. The product splits, and a two-carbon compound leaves the chloroplast. Peroxisomes and mitochondria rearrange and split this compound, releasing CO2. The process is called photorespiration because it occurs in the light (photo) and consumes O2 while producing CO2 (respiration). However, unlike normal cellular respiration, 
photorespiration generates no ATP; in fact, photorespiration consumes ATP. And unlike photosynthesis, photorespiration produces no sugar. In fact, photorespiration decreases photosynthetic output by siphoning organic material from the Calvin cycle and releasing CO2 that would otherwise be fixed. How can we explain the existence of a metabolic process that seems to be counterproductive for the plant? According to one hypothesis, photorespiration is evolutionary baggage: a metabolic relic from a much earlier time when the atmosphere had less O2 and more CO2 than it does today. In the ancient atmosphere that prevailed when rubisco first evolved, the inability of the enzyme's active site to exclude O2 would have made little difference. The hypothesis suggests that modern rubisco retains some of its chance affinity for O2, which is now so concentrated in the atmosphere that a certain amount of photorespiration is inevitable. We now know that, at least in some cases, photorespiration plays a protective role in 
plants. Plants that are impaired in their ability to carry out photorespiration (due to defective genes) are more susceptible to damage induced by excess light. Researchers consider this clear evidence that photorespiration acts to neutralize the otherwise damaging products of the light reactions, which build up when a low CO2 concentration limits the progress of the Calvin cycle. Whether there are other benefits of photorespiration is still unknown. In many types of plants: including a significant number of crop plants: photorespiration drains away as much as 50% of the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle. As heterotrophs that depend on carbon fixation in chloroplasts for our food, we naturally view photorespiration as wasteful. Indeed, if photorespiration could be reduced in certain plant species without otherwise affecting photosynthetic productivity, crop yields and food supplies might increase.</justification>

        <justification>Under certain conditions, it may be beneficial to reduce the efficiency of cellular respiration. A remarkable adaptation is shown by hibernating mammals, which overwinter in a state of inactivity and lowered metabolism. Although their internal body temperature is lower than normal, it still must be kept significantly higher than the external air temperature. One type of tissue, called brown fat, is made up of cells packed full of mitochondria. The inner mitochondrial membrane contains a channel protein called the uncoupling protein, which allows protons to flow back down their concentration gradient without generating ATP. Activation of these proteins in hibernating mammals results in ongoing oxidation of stored fuel stores (fats), generating heat without any ATP production. In the absence of such an adaptation, the ATP level would build up to a point that cellular respiration would be shut down due to regulatory mechanisms to be discussed later.</justification>

        <justification>Heterotrophs obtain their organic material by the second major mode of nutrition. Unable to make their own food, they live on compounds produced by other organisms (hetero- means "other"). Heterotrophs are the biosphere's consumers. The most obvious form of this "other-feeding" occurs when an animal eats plants or other animals. But heterotrophic nutrition may be more subtle. Some heterotrophs consume the remains of dead organisms by decomposing and feeding on organic litter such as carcasses, feces, and fallen leaves; they are known as decomposers. Most fungi and many types of prokaryotes get their nourishment this way. Almost all heterotrophs, including humans, are completely dependent, either directly or indirectly, on photoautotrophs for food: and also for oxygen, a by-product of photosynthesis.</justification>

    <text>Why does the lateral movement of phospholipids in the plasma membrane occur many times per second while flip-flopping is extremely rare?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Membranes are not static sheets of molecules locked rigidly in place. A membrane is held together primarily by hydrophobic interactions, which are much weaker than covalent bonds (see Figure 5.20). Most of the lipids and some of the proteins can shift about laterally: that is, in the plane of the membrane, like partygoers elbowing their way through a crowded room (Figure 7.6). It is quite rare, however, for a molecule to flip-flop transversely across the membrane, switching from one phospholipid layer to the other; to do so, the hydrophilic part of the molecule must cross the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. The lateral movement of phospholipids within the membrane is rapid. Adjacent phospholipids switch positions about 107 times per second, which means that a phospholipid can travel about 2 microm: the length of many bacterial cells: in 1 second.</justification>

    <text>Why is pyruvate considered a key junction in catabolism?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 9.18 Pyruvate as a key juncture in catabolism. Glycolysis is common to fermentation and cellular respiration. The end product of glycolysis, pyruvate, represents a fork in the catabolic pathways of glucose oxidation. In a facultative anaerobe or a muscle cell, which are capable of both aerobic cellular respiration and fermentation, pyruvate is committed to one of those two pathways, usually depending on whether or not oxygen is present. Some organisms, called obligate anaerobes, carry out only fermentation or anaerobic respiration. In fact, these organisms cannot survive in the presence of oxygen, some forms of which can actually be toxic if protective systems are not present in the cell. A few cell types, such as cells of the vertebrate brain, can carry out only aerobic oxidation of pyruvate, not fermentation. Other organisms, including yeasts and many bacteria, can make enough ATP to survive using either fermentation or respiration. Such species are called facultative 
anaerobes. On the cellular level, our muscle cells behave as facultative anaerobes. In such cells, pyruvate is a fork in the metabolic road that leads to two alternative catabolic routes (Figure 9.18). Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate can be converted to acetyl CoA, and oxidation continues in the citric acid cycle via aerobic respiration. Under anaerobic conditions, lactic acid fermentation occurs: Pyruvate is diverted from the citric acid cycle, serving instead as an electron acceptor to recycle NAD+. To make the same amount of ATP, a facultative anaerobe has to consume sugar at a much faster rate when fermenting than when respiring.</justification>

    <text>Why are most metabolic reactions reversible?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Like most systems, a living cell is not in equilibrium. The constant flow of materials in and out of the cell keeps the metabolic pathways from ever reaching equilibrium, and the cell continues to do work throughout its life. This principle is illustrated by the open (and more realistic) hydroelectric system in Figure 8.7b. However, unlike this simple single-step system, a catabolic pathway in a cell releases free energy in a series of reactions. An example is cellular respiration, illustrated by analogy in Figure 8.7c. Some of the reversible reactions of respiration are constantly "pulled" in one direction: that is, they are kept out of equilibrium. The key to maintaining this lack of equilibrium is that the product of a reaction does not accumulate but instead becomes a reactant in the next step; finally, waste products are expelled from the cell. The overall sequence of reactions is kept going by the huge free-energy difference between glucose and oxygen at the top of the energy "
hill" and carbon dioxide and water at the "downhill" end. As long as our cells have a steady supply of glucose or other fuels and oxygen and are able to expel waste products to the surroundings, their metabolic pathways never reach equilibrium and can continue to do the work of life.</justification>

    <text>Why are 2 electrons and 1 proton transferred to nad+, and why not just 1 electron?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Cellular respiration does not oxidize glucose in a single explosive step either. Rather, glucose and other organic fuels are broken down in a series of steps, each one catalyzed by an enzyme. At key steps, electrons are stripped from the glucose. As is often the case in oxidation reactions, each electron travels with a proton: thus, as a hydrogen atom. The hydrogen atoms are not transferred directly to oxygen, but instead are usually passed first to an electron carrier, a coenzyme called NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, a derivative of the vitamin niacin). NAD+ is well suited as an electron carrier because it can cycle easily between oxidized (NAD+) and reduced (NADH) states. As an electron acceptor, NAD+ functions as an oxidizing agent during respiration. Figure 9.4 NAD+ as an electron shuttle. The full name for NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, describes its structure: The molecule consists of two nucleotides joined together at their phosphate groups (shown in yellow). 
(Nicotinamide is a nitrogenous base, although not one that is present in DNA or RNA; see Figure 5.26. ) The enzymatic transfer of 2 electrons and 1 proton (H+) from an organic molecule in food to NAD+ reduces the NAD+ to NADH; the second proton (H+) is released. Most of the electrons removed from food are transferred initially to NAD+. How does NAD+ trap electrons from glucose and other organic molecules? Enzymes called dehydrogenases remove a pair of hydrogen atoms (2 electrons and 2 protons) from the substrate (glucose, in this example), thereby oxidizing it. The enzyme delivers the 2 electrons along with 1 proton to its coenzyme, NAD+ (Figure 9.4). The other proton is released as a hydrogen ion (H+) into the surrounding solution: By receiving 2 negatively charged electrons but only 1 positively charged proton, NAD+ has its charge neutralized when it is reduced to NADH. The name NADH shows the hydrogen that has been received in the reaction. NAD+ is the most versatile electron acceptor in cellular 
respiration and functions in several of the redox steps during the breakdown of glucose.</justification>

    <text>Why does cellular respiration promote the process of oxygen diffusion?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Much of the traffic across cell membranes occurs by diffusion. When a substance is more concentrated on one side of a membrane than on the other, there is a tendency for the substance to diffuse across the membrane down its concentration gradient (assuming that the membrane is permeable to that substance). One important example is the uptake of oxygen by a cell performing cellular respiration. Dissolved oxygen diffuses into the cell across the plasma membrane. As long as cellular respiration consumes the O2 as it enters, diffusion into the cell will continue because the concentration gradient favors movement in that direction. The diffusion of a substance across a biological membrane is called passive transport because the cell does not have to expend energy to make it happen. The concentration gradient itself represents potential energy (see Chapter 2, p. 35) and drives diffusion.</justification>

The net energy yield from glycolysis, per glucose molecule, is 2 ATP plus 2 NADH. The ten steps of the glycolytic pathway are shown in Figure 9.9.</justification>

    <text>Why is nadp+ considered an acceptor?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>The light reactions are the steps of photosynthesis that convert solar energy to chemical energy. Water is split, providing a source of electrons and protons (hydrogen ions, H+) and giving off O2 as a by-product. Light absorbed by chlorophyll drives a transfer of the electrons and hydrogen ions from water to an acceptor called NADP+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), where they are temporarily stored. The electron acceptor NADP+ is first cousin to NAD+, which functions as an electron carrier in cellular respiration; the two molecules differ only by the presence of an extra phosphate group in the NADP+ molecule. The light reactions use solar power to reduce NADP+ to NADPH by adding a pair of electrons along with an H+. The light reactions also generate ATP, using chemiosmosis to power the addition of a phosphate group to ADP, a process called photophosphorylation. Thus, light energy is initially converted to chemical energy in the form of two compounds: NADPH, a source of 
electrons as "reducing power" that can be passed along to an electron acceptor, reducing it, and ATP, the versatile energy currency of cells. Notice that the light reactions produce no sugar; that happens in the second stage of photosynthesis, the Calvin cycle.</justification>

According to one hypothesis, photorespiration is evolutionary baggage: a metabolic relic from a much earlier time when the atmosphere had less O2 and more CO2 than it does today. In the ancient atmosphere that prevailed when rubisco first evolved, the inability of the enzyme's active site to exclude O2 would have made little difference. The hypothesis suggests that modern rubisco retains some of its chance affinity for O2, which is now so concentrated in the atmosphere that a certain amount of photorespiration is inevitable.</justification>

    <text>Why must the regeneration of atp from adp and inorganic phosphate be endergonic?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 8.11 The ATP cycle. Energy released by breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell is used to phosphorylate ADP, regenerating ATP. Chemical potential energy stored in ATP drives most cellular work. An organism at work uses ATP continuously, but ATP is a renewable resource that can be regenerated by the addition of phosphate to ADP (Figure 8.11). The free energy required to phosphorylate ADP comes from exergonic breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell. This shuttling of inorganic phosphate and energy is called the ATP cycle, and it couples the cell's energy-yielding (exergonic) processes to the energy-consuming (endergonic) ones. The ATP cycle proceeds at an astonishing pace. For example, a working muscle cell recycles its entire pool of ATP in less than a minute. That turnover represents 10 million molecules of ATP consumed and regenerated per second per cell. If ATP could not be regenerated by the phosphorylation of ADP, humans would use up nearly their body weight in ATP 
each day. Because both directions of a reversible process cannot be downhill, the regeneration of ATP from ADP and &amp;#9413;i is necessarily endergonic: ADP + &amp;#9413;i &amp;rarr; ATP + H2O &amp;Delta;G = +7.3 kcal/mol (+30.5 kJ/mol) (standard conditions) Since ATP formation from ADP and &amp;#9413;i is not spontaneous, free energy must be spent to make it occur. Catabolic (exergonic) pathways, especially cellular respiration, provide the energy for the endergonic process of making ATP. Plants also use light energy to produce ATP. Thus, the ATP cycle is a revolving door through which energy passes during its transfer from catabolic to anabolic pathways.</justification>

A gram of fat stores more than twice as much energy as a gram of a polysaccharide, such as starch. Because plants are relatively immobile, they can function with bulky energy storage in the form of starch. (Vegetable oils are generally obtained from seeds, where more compact storage is an asset to the plant. ) Animals, however, must carry their energy stores with them, so there is an advantage to having a more compact reservoir of fuel: fat. Humans and other mammals stock their long-term food reserves in adipose cells (see Figure 4.6a), which swell and shrink as fat is deposited and withdrawn from storage.</justification>

    <text>Why does the surface of a pure phospholipids bilayer adhere less strongly to water than does the surface of a biological membrane?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>If a phospholipid bilayer was the main fabric of a membrane, where were the proteins located? Although the heads of phospholipids are hydrophilic, the surface of a pure phospholipid bilayer adheres less strongly to water than does the surface of a biological membrane. Given this difference, Hugh Davson and James Danielli suggested in 1935 that the membrane might be coated on both sides with hydrophilic proteins. They proposed a sandwich model: a phospholipid bilayer between two layers of proteins. When researchers first used electron microscopes to study cells in the 1950s, the pictures seemed to support the Davson-Danielli model. By the late 1960s, however, many cell biologists recognized two problems with the model. First, inspection of a variety of membranes revealed that membranes with different functions differ in structure and chemical composition. A second, more serious problem became apparent once membrane proteins were better characterized. Unlike proteins dissolved in the 
cytosol, membrane proteins are not very soluble in water because they are amphipathic. If such proteins were layered on the surface of the membrane, their hydrophobic parts would be in aqueous surroundings. Figure 7.3 The original fluid mosaic model for membranes. Taking these observations into account, S. J. Singer and G. Nicolson proposed in 1972 that membrane proteins reside in the phospholipid bilayer with their hydrophilic regions protruding (Figure 7.3). This molecular arrangement would maximize contact of hydrophilic regions of proteins and phospholipids with water in the cytosol and extracellular fluid, while providing their hydrophobic parts with a nonaqueous environment. In this fluid mosaic model, the membrane is a mosaic of protein molecules bobbing in a fluid bilayer of phospholipids.</justification>

For example, a protein may consist of thousands of atoms that form a molecular colossus with a mass well over 100,000 daltons.

Building a huge variety of polymers from such a limited number of monomers is analogous to constructing hundreds of thousands of words from only 26 letters of the alphabet. The key is arrangement: the particular linear sequence that the units follow. However, this analogy falls far short of describing the great diversity of macromolecules because most biological polymers have many more monomers than the number of letters in the longest word.

        <justification>Once we have learned the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide, what can it tell us about the three-dimensional structure (commonly referred to simply as the "structure") of the protein and its function? The term polypeptide is not synonymous with the term protein. Even for a protein consisting of a single polypeptide, the relationship is somewhat analogous to that between a long strand of yarn and a sweater of particular size and shape that can be knit from the yarn. A functional protein is not just a polypeptide chain, but one or more polypeptides precisely twisted, folded, and coiled into a molecule of unique shape (Figure 5.18). And it is the amino acid sequence of each polypeptide that determines what three-dimensional structure the protein will have under normal cellular conditions. When a cell synthesizes a polypeptide, the chain generally folds spontaneously, assuming the functional structure for that protein. This folding is driven and reinforced by the formation of a variety

    <text>Why would high soil salinity hurt plants?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>An excess of sodium chloride or other salts in the soil threatens plants for two reasons. First, by lowering the water potential of the soil solution, salt can cause a water deficit in plants even though the soil has plenty of water. As the water potential of the soil solution becomes more negative, the water potential gradient from soil to roots is lowered, thereby reducing water uptake (see Chapter 36). Another problem with saline soil is that sodium and certain other ions are toxic to plants when their concentrations are so high that they overwhelm the selective permeability capabilities of the root cell membranes. Many plants can respond to moderate soil salinity by producing solutes that are well tolerated at high concentrations: These mostly organic compounds keep the water potential of cells more negative than that of the soil solution without admitting toxic quantities of salt. However, most plants cannot survive salt stress for long. The exceptions are halophytes, salt-
tolerant plants with adaptations such as salt glands that pump salts out across the leaf epidermis.</justification>

    <text>Why is glycerol such an important molecule?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 5.10 The synthesis and structure of a fat, or triacylglycerol. The molecular building blocks of a fat are one molecule of glycerol and three molecules of fatty acids. (a) One water molecule is removed for each fatty acid joined to the glycerol. (b) A fat molecule with three fatty acid units, two of them identical. The carbons of the fatty acids are arranged zigzag to suggest the actual orientations of the four single bonds extending from each carbon (see Figure 4.3a). Although fats are not polymers, they are large molecules assembled from smaller molecules by dehydration reactions. A fat is constructed from two kinds of smaller molecules: glycerol and fatty acids (Figure 5.10a). Glycerol is an alcohol; each of its three carbons bears a hydroxyl group. A fatty acid has a long carbon skeleton, usually 16 or 18 carbon atoms in length. The carbon at one end of the skeleton is part of a carboxyl group, the functional group that gives these molecules the name fatty acid. The rest of 
the skeleton consists of a hydrocarbon chain. The relatively nonpolar C-H bonds in the hydrocarbon chains of fatty acids are the reason fats are hydrophobic. Fats separate from water because the water molecules hydrogen-bond to one another and exclude the fats. This is the reason that vegetable oil (a liquid fat) separates from the aqueous vinegar solution in a bottle of salad dressing. In making a fat, three fatty acid molecules are each joined to glycerol by an ester linkage, a bond between a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group. The resulting fat, also called a triacylglycerol, thus consists of three fatty acids linked to one glycerol molecule. (Still another name for a fat is triglyceride, a word often found in the list of ingredients on packaged foods. ) The fatty acids in a fat can be the same, or they can be of two or three different kinds, as in Figure 5.10b.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Catabolism can also harvest energy stored in fats obtained either from food or from storage cells in the body. After fats are digested to glycerol and fatty acids, the glycerol is converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an intermediate of glycolysis. Most of the energy of a fat is stored in the fatty acids. A metabolic sequence called beta oxidation breaks the fatty acids down to two-carbon fragments, which enter the citric acid cycle as acetyl CoA. NADH and FADH2 are also generated during beta oxidation; they can enter the electron transport chain, leading to further ATP production. Fats make excellent fuel, in large part due to their chemical structure and the high energy level of their electrons (equally shared between carbon and hydrogen) compared to those of carbohydrates. A gram of fat oxidized by respiration produces more than twice as much ATP as a gram of carbohydrate. Unfortunately, this also means that a person trying to lose weight must work hard to use up fat stored in 
the body because so many calories are stockpiled in each gram of fat.</justification>

    <text>Why does isoleucine undergo feedback inhibition?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Figure 8.21 Feedback inhibition in isoleucine synthesis. When ATP allosterically inhibits an enzyme in an ATP-generating pathway, as we discussed earlier, the result is feedback inhibition, a common mode of metabolic control. In feedback inhibition, a metabolic pathway is switched off by the inhibitory binding of its end product to an enzyme that acts early in the pathway. Figure 8.21 shows an example of this control mechanism operating on an anabolic pathway. Certain cells use this five-step pathway to synthesize the amino acid isoleucine from threonine, another amino acid. As isoleucine accumulates, it slows down its own synthesis by allosterically inhibiting the enzyme for the first step of the pathway. Feedback inhibition thereby prevents the cell from wasting chemical resources by making more isoleucine than is necessary.</justification>

    <text>Why is there a difference in the concentration of h+ on opposite sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>How does the inner mitochondrial membrane or the prokaryotic plasma membrane generate and maintain the H+ gradient that drives ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase protein complex? Establishing the H+ gradient is a major function of the electron transport chain, which is shown in its mitochondrial location in Figure 9.15. The chain is an energy converter that uses the exergonic flow of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to pump H+ across the membrane, from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. The H+ has a tendency to move back across the membrane, diffusing down its gradient. And the ATP synthases are the only sites that provide a route through the membrane for H+. As we described previously, the passage of H+ through ATP synthase uses the exergonic flow of H+ to drive the phosphorylation of ADP. Thus, the energy stored in an H+ gradient across a membrane couples the redox reactions of the electron transport chain to ATP synthesis, an example of chemiosmosis. At this point, 
you may be wondering how the electron transport chain pumps hydrogen ions. Researchers have found that certain members of the electron transport chain accept and release protons (H+) along with electrons. (The aqueous solutions inside and surrounding the cell are a ready source of H+. ) At certain steps along the chain, electron transfers cause H+ to be taken up and released into the surrounding solution. In eukaryotic cells, the electron carriers are spatially arranged in the inner mitochondrial membrane in such a way that H+ is accepted from the mitochondrial matrix and deposited in the intermembrane space (see Figure 9.15). The H+ gradient that results is referred to as a proton-motive force, emphasizing the capacity of the gradient to perform work. The force drives H+ back across the membrane through the H+ channels provided by ATP synthases. In general terms, chemiosmosis is an energy-coupling mechanism that uses energy stored in the form of an H+ gradient across a membrane to drive cellular work. In 
mitochondria, the energy for gradient formation comes from exergonic redox reactions, and ATP synthesis is the work performed.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>Potential energy is the energy that matter possesses because of its location or structure. For example, water in a reservoir on a hill has potential energy because of its altitude. When the gates of the reservoir's dam are opened and the water runs downhill, the energy can be used to do work, such as turning generators. Because energy has been expended, the water has less energy at the bottom of the hill than it did in the reservoir. Matter has a natural tendency to move to the lowest possible state of potential energy; in this example, the water runs downhill. To restore the potential energy of a reservoir, work must be done to elevate the water against gravity.</justification>

      <answer>
        <justification>As you read in Chapter 54, ecologists assign species to trophic levels based on their main source of nutrition and energy. The trophic level that ultimately supports all others consists of autotrophs, also called the primary producers of the ecosystem. Most autotrophs are photosynthetic organisms that use light energy to synthesize sugars and other organic compounds, which they then use as fuel for cellular respiration and as building material for growth. Plants, algae, and photosynthetic prokaryotes are the biosphere's main autotrophs, although chemosynthetic prokaryotes are the primary producers in ecosystems such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents (see Figure 52.16) and places deep under the ground or ice (see Figure 55.1). Organisms in trophic levels above the primary producers are heterotrophs, which depend directly or indirectly on the outputs of primary producers for their source of energy. Herbivores, which eat plants and other primary producers, are primary consumers. Carnivores 
that eat herbivores are secondary consumers, and carnivores that eat other carnivores are tertiary consumers.</justification>

        <justification>Each day, Earth's atmosphere is bombarded by about 1022 joules of solar radiation (1 J = 0.239 cal). This is enough energy to supply the demands of the entire human population for approximately 25 years at 2009 energy consumption levels. As described in Chapter 52, the intensity of the solar energy striking Earth varies with latitude, with the tropics receiving the greatest input. Most incoming solar radiation is absorbed, scattered, or reflected by clouds and dust in the atmosphere. The amount of solar radiation that ultimately reaches Earth's surface limits the possible photosynthetic output of ecosystems. Only a small fraction of the sunlight that reaches Earth's surface is actually used in photosynthesis. Much of the radiation strikes materials that don't photosynthesize, such as ice and soil. Of the radiation that does reach photosynthetic organisms, only certain wavelengths are absorbed by photosynthetic pigments (see Figure 10.9); the rest is transmitted, reflected, or lost as 
heat. As a result, only about 1% of the visible light that strikes photosynthetic organisms is converted to chemical energy. Nevertheless, Earth's primary producers create about 150 billion metric tons (1.50 * 1014 kg) of organic material each year.</justification>

        <justification>Total primary production in an ecosystem is known as that ecosystem's gross primary production (GPP): the amount of energy from light (or chemicals, in chemoautotrophic systems) converted to the chemical energy of organic molecules per unit time. Not all of this production is stored as organic material in the primary producers because they use some of the molecules as fuel in their own cellular respiration. Net primary production (NPP) is equal to gross primary production minus the energy used by the primary producers for their "autotrophic respiration" (Ra): NPP = GPP -' Ra On average, NPP is about one-half of GPP. To ecologists, net primary production is the key measurement because it represents the storage of chemical energy that will be available to consumers in the ecosystem. Net primary production can be expressed as energy per unit area per unit time (J/m2'yr) or as biomass (mass of vegetation) added per unit area per unit time (g/m2'yr). (Note that biomass is usually expressed 
in terms of the dry mass of organic material. ) An ecosystem's NPP should not be confused with the total biomass of photosynthetic autotrophs present, a measure called the standing crop. Net primary production is the amount of new biomass added in a given period of time. Although a forest has a large standing crop, its net primary production may actually be less than that of some grasslands; grasslands do not accumulate as much biomass as forests because animals consume the plants rapidly and because grasses and herbs decompose more quickly than trees do.</justification>

The reaction-center chlorophyll a of photosystem II is known as P680 because this pigment is best at absorbing light having a wavelength of 680 nm (in the red part of the spectrum). The chlorophyll a at the reaction-center complex of photosystem I is called P700 because it most effectively absorbs light of wavelength 700 nm (in the far-red part of the spectrum). These two pigments, P680 and P700, are nearly identical chlorophyll a molecules. However, their association with different proteins in the thylakoid membrane

      </answer>
      <answer>
        <justification>To pump a solute across a membrane against its gradient requires work; the cell must expend energy. Therefore, this type of membrane traffic is called active transport. The transport proteins that move solutes against their concentration gradients are all carrier proteins rather than channel proteins. This makes sense because when channel proteins are open, they merely allow solutes to diffuse down their concentration gradients rather than picking them up and transporting them against their gradients. Figure 7.18 The sodium-potassium pump: a specific case of active transport. This transport system pumps ions against steep concentration gradients: Sodium ion concentration ([Na+]) is high outside the cell and low inside, while potassium ion concentration ([K+]) is low outside the cell and high inside. The pump oscillates between two shapes in a cycle that moves 3 Na+ out of the cell for every 2 K+ pumped into the cell. The two shapes have different affinities for Na+ and K+. ATP powers 
the shape change by transferring a phosphate group to the transport protein (phosphorylating the protein). Active transport enables a cell to maintain internal concentrations of small solutes that differ from concentrations in its environment. For example, compared with its surroundings, an animal cell has a much higher concentration of potassium ions (K+) and a much lower concentration of sodium ions (Na+). The plasma membrane helps maintain these steep gradients by pumping Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell. Figure 7.19 Review: passive and active transport. As in other types of cellular work, ATP supplies the energy for most active transport. One way ATP can power active transport is by transferring its terminal phosphate group directly to the transport protein. This can induce the protein to change its shape in a manner that translocates a solute bound to the protein across the membrane. One transport system that works this way is the sodium-potassium pump, which exchanges Na+ for K+ across the 
plasma membrane of animal cells (Figure 7.18).</justification>

        <justification>Figure 8.9 How ATP drives chemical work: Energy coupling using ATP hydrolysis. In this example, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis is used to drive an endergonic process: the cellular synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid and ammonia. For example, with the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to use the energy released by ATP hydrolysis directly to drive chemical reactions that, by themselves, are endergonic. If the deltaG of an endergonic reaction is less than the amount of energy released by ATP hydrolysis, then the two reactions can be coupled so that, overall, the coupled reactions are exergonic (Figure 8.9). This usually involves the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to some other molecule, such as the reactant. The recipient with the phosphate group covalently bonded to it is then called a phosphorylated intermediate. The key to coupling exergonic and endergonic reactions is the formation of this phosphorylated intermediate, which is more 
reactive (less stable) than the original unphosphorylated molecule. Figure 8.10 How ATP drives transport and mechanical work. ATP hydrolysis causes changes in the shapes and binding affinities of proteins. This can occur either (a) directly, by phosphorylation, as shown for a membrane protein carrying out active transport of a solute (see also Figure 7.18), or (b) indirectly, via noncovalent binding of ATP and its hydrolytic products, as is the case for motor proteins that move vesicles (and other organelles) along cytoskeletal "tracks" in the cell (see also Figure 6.21). Transport and mechanical work in the cell are also nearly always powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. In these cases, ATP hydrolysis leads to a change in a protein's shape and often its ability to bind another molecule. Sometimes this occurs via a phosphorylated intermediate, as seen for the transport protein in Figure 8.10a.</justification>

    <text>Why can't we calculate the exact number of atp molecules produced by the breakdown of one molecule of glucose?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Why are the numbers in Figure 9.16 inexact? There are three reasons we cannot state an exact number of ATP molecules generated by the breakdown of one molecule of glucose. First, phosphorylation and the redox reactions are not directly coupled to each other, so the ratio of the number of NADH molecules to the number of ATP molecules is not a whole number. We know that 1 NADH results in 10 H+ being transported out across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but the exact number of H+ that must reenter the mitochondrial matrix via ATP synthase to generate 1 ATP has long been debated. Based on experimental data, however, most biochemists now agree that the most accurate number is 4 H+. Therefore, a single molecule of NADH generates enough proton-motive force for the synthesis of 2.5 ATP. The citric acid cycle also supplies electrons to the electron transport chain via FADH2, but since its electrons enter later in the chain, each molecule of this electron carrier is responsible for transport 
of only enough H+ for the synthesis of 1.5 ATP. These numbers also take into account the slight energetic cost of moving the ATP formed in the mitochondrion out into the cytosol, where it will be used. Second, the ATP yield varies slightly depending on the type of shuttle used to transport electrons from the cytosol into the mitochondrion. The mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to NADH, so NADH in the cytosol is segregated from the machinery of oxidative phosphorylation. The 2 electrons of NADH captured in glycolysis must be conveyed into the mitochondrion by one of several electron shuttle systems. Depending on the kind of shuttle in a particular cell type, the electrons are passed either to NAD+ or to FAD in the mitochondrial matrix (see Figure 9.16). If the electrons are passed to FAD, as in brain cells, only about 1.5 ATP can result from each NADH that was originally generated in the cytosol. If the electrons are passed to mitochondrial NAD+, as in liver cells and heart cells, the yield is about 
2.5 ATP per NADH. A third variable that reduces the yield of ATP is the use of the proton-motive force generated by the redox reactions of respiration to drive other kinds of work. For example, the proton-motive force powers the mitochondrion's uptake of pyruvate from the cytosol. However, if all the proton-motive force generated by the electron transport chain were used to drive ATP synthesis, one glucose molecule could generate a maximum of 28 ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation plus 4 ATP (net) from substrate-level phosphorylation to give a total yield of about 32 ATP (or only about 30 ATP if the less efficient shuttle were functioning).</justification>

    <text>Why is the interior of a lipid bilayer hydrophobic?</text>
    <answers>
      <answer>
        <justification>Cells could not exist without another type of lipid: phospholipids (Figure 5.12). Phospholipids are essential for cells because they make up cell membranes. Their structure provides a classic example of how form fits function at the molecular level. As shown in Figure 5.12, a phospholipid is similar to a fat molecule but has only two fatty acids attached to glycerol rather than three. The third hydroxyl group of glycerol is joined to a phosphate group, which has a negative electrical charge in the cell. Additional small molecules, which are usually charged or polar, can be linked to the phosphate group to form a variety of phospholipids. Figure 5.13 Bilayer structure formed by self-assembly of phospholipids in an aqueous environment. The phospholipid bilayer shown here is the main fabric of biological membranes. Note that the hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids are in contact with water in this structure, whereas the hydrophobic tails are in contact with each other and remote from 
water. The two ends of phospholipids show different behavior toward water. The hydrocarbon tails are hydrophobic and are excluded from water. However, the phosphate group and its attachments form a hydrophilic head that has an affinity for water. When phospholipids are added to water, they self-assemble into double-layered structures called "bilayers," shielding their hydrophobic portions from water (Figure 5.13). At the surface of a cell, phospholipids are arranged in a similar bilayer. The hydrophilic heads of the molecules are on the outside of the bilayer, in contact with the aqueous solutions inside and outside of the cell. The hydrophobic tails point toward the interior of the bilayer, away from the water. The phospholipid bilayer forms a boundary between the cell and its external environment; in fact, cells could not exist without phospholipids.</justification>

        <justification>Figure 7.2 Phospholipid bilayer (cross section). Scientists began building molecular models of the membrane decades before membranes were first seen with the electron microscope (in the 1950s). In 1915, membranes isolated from red blood cells were chemically analyzed and found to be composed of lipids and proteins. Ten years later, two Dutch scientists reasoned that cell membranes must be phospholipid bilayers. Such a double layer of molecules could exist as a stable boundary between two aqueous compartments because the molecular arrangement shelters the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipids from water while exposing the hydrophilic heads to water (Figure 7.2). If a phospholipid bilayer was the main fabric of a membrane, where were the proteins located? Although the heads of phospholipids are hydrophilic, the surface of a pure phospholipid bilayer adheres less strongly to water than does the surface of a biological membrane. Given this difference, Hugh Davson and James Danielli 
suggested in 1935 that the membrane might be coated on both sides with hydrophilic proteins. They proposed a sandwich model: a phospholipid bilayer between two layers of proteins. When researchers first used electron microscopes to study cells in the 1950s, the pictures seemed to support the Davson-Danielli model. By the late 1960s, however, many cell biologists recognized two problems with the model. First, inspection of a variety of membranes revealed that membranes with different functions differ in structure and chemical composition. A second, more serious problem became apparent once membrane proteins were better characterized. Unlike proteins dissolved in the cytosol, membrane proteins are not very soluble in water because they are amphipathic. If such proteins were layered on the surface of the membrane, their hydrophobic parts would be in aqueous surroundings. Figure 7.3 The original fluid mosaic model for membranes. Taking these observations into account, S. J. Singer and G. Nicolson proposed in 
1972 that membrane proteins reside in the phospholipid bilayer with their hydrophilic regions protruding (Figure 7.3). This molecular arrangement would maximize contact of hydrophilic regions of proteins and phospholipids with water in the cytosol and extracellular fluid, while providing their hydrophobic parts with a nonaqueous environment. In this fluid mosaic model, the membrane is a mosaic of protein molecules bobbing in a fluid bilayer of phospholipids. A method of preparing cells for electron microscopy called freeze-fracture has demonstrated visually that proteins are indeed embedded in the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane (Figure 7.4). Freeze-fracture splits a membrane along the middle of the bilayer, somewhat like pulling apart a chunky peanut butter sandwich. When the membrane layers are viewed in the electron microscope, the interior of the bilayer appears cobblestoned, with protein particles interspersed in a smooth matrix, in agreement with the fluid mosaic model. Some proteins remain 
attached to one layer or the other, like the peanut chunks in the sandwich.</justification>
